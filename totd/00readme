The program in this directory allow you to access a tip-of-the-day file.
It will access one tip at random and display it in its standard
output.

The program 'totd-cgi' is a cgi helper application for HTTP daemons
and generates HTML output.

To install the program you must first edit the Makefile, giving the
appropriate pathnames and run make.

Without arguments 'make' will build the executables in the current
directory.

'make all' is the same as 'make': it just builds the executables.

'make install' will install everything.

'make installbin' will only install the binaries, which is handy when you
have already installed the data files and want to make changes or debug
the programs.

'make uninstall' will remove all the installed files. Please, be sure you
no longer need any of them.

CREDITS: most of the backgrounds have been picked from the net. Well, actually
all of them. Wonderful thing the net. Really. Amazing.

	The programs where made by me, José R. Valverde, to provide my 
users with a tip of the day when connecting to a web page. The way I
call this is using

- --------------------
<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="javascript"><!--
function openNewWindow(fileName,windowName,theWidth,theHeight) {
        window.open(fileName,windowName,
	"toolbar=0,location=0,directories=0,status=0,menubar=0,scrollbars=0,resizable=0,width="+theWidth+",height="+theHeight)
}

--></SCRIPT>

<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="javascript"><!--
    openNewWindow('/cgi-bin/cookie-cgi', 'inlineHelpWindow',200,200)
--></SCRIPT>

- --------------------

The format of the Tip-Of-The-Day database is rather simple: any line
starting with a space character " " (NOTE that it is NOT a blank, it 
must be space) starts a tip, and it will continue over subsequent lines
starting with a space until a new tip is found.


DISCLAIMER: the programs are unsupported. And all the usual disclaimers 
apply: I don't assume any responsibility either express or implied or of
any type at all regarding anything at all relative to these programs and
son on, etc, etc, etc...

			Have fun!
