  	mailn CGI is based on a previous mail interface written
   by Benny Shomer at the EBI, and Reuven M. Lerner from The Tech.

    	The scripts have been expanded and modified by José R. Valverde
   at EMBnet/CNB to be made more generic and complete.
   
    These files have gone a long way and undergone many modifications.
    I don't have access to the original files any longer (sorry).


These CGIs implement a system-wide mail interface that avoid use of
actual e-mail addresses in web pages, hence effectively hidden real
email addresses and usernames from the outside world.

It exposes part of the GECOS field though, i.e. the actual person's
name, but since it is intended to be used in public institutions where
this data is already mandatorily free, that's not too bad.

In any case, you can always choose not to run the automated database
building script and create it by hand, in which case you select yourself
which information is actually disclosed in web pages. A sample database
file I use here is included.

To install it, simply edit the makefile, change paths and defaults to
suit your local setup and then

    make all
    make install
    
If you decide to remove it later, you can always run

    make uninstall
    
This will install the base scripts. You can then refer to any user in
a web page by using his/her long name in the database file (substituting
spaces by plus signs).

    <A HREF="/cgi-bin/emailto?Network+Administrator">Webmaster</A>


A couple of additional sample scripts are provided. These are intended
to be called as if they were HTML web pages. When called, they build
a web page listing all people in the database and providing links to
mail them.

There are two of these, a short version which relies on an existing
database (e.g. if you keep a customized one or update it by special means 
like a cron job), and a long one which rebuilds the database first and then
makes the web page (if you just use the password file as source for
user addresses). They are

    contactus.short.pl
    contactus.html

We have a page listing the staff here, and from this we make a link to
one of these scripts to provide a suitable mail interface for reaching
our users without giving any info away to spammers. The long one which
remakes the database every time before computing the web page ensures
that clients always get an up-to-date listing of e-mail contacts.

There is no provision for searching for a user. That's IMHO unneeded
since all a user needs to do is use his browser "find in page" functionality
to achieve the same results.

If you decide to use any of them, review it first, specially the long one,
where you may want to add more exclusion clauses to reduce the addresses
exposed below
    	# filter out system users
    	next if ( $gid < 100 );

then copy it to your cgi-bin directory and call it as if it were a web page.

And REMEMBER

    THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES.
    
    If you want to feel reassured, read the source.
    If you find any bug, I'd appreciate hearing of it.
