<P>A truncated Newton minimization method which requires potential energy, 
gradient and Hessian information. This
procedure has significant advantages over standard Newton methods, and is 
able to minimize very large structures
completely. Several options are provided with respect to minimization 
method and preconditioning of the Newton
equations. The default options are recommended unless the user is 
familiar with the math involved. This program
operates in Cartesian coordinate space and is fairly tolerant of poor 
input structures. Typical algorithm iteration
times are longer than with nonlinear conjugate gradient or variable 
metric methods, but many fewer iterations are
required for complete minimization. NEWTON is usually the best 
choice for minimizations to the 0.01 to 0.000001
kcal/mole/Å level of rms gradient convergence. Tests for directions 
of negative curvature can be removed, allowing
NEWTON to be used for optimization to conformational transition state 
structures (this only works if the starting
point is very close to the transition state).</P>

<P>Typically you would use another method that advances and converges
faster to start the minimization (like MINIMIZE or OPTIMIZE) and refine
your structure to a coarser RMS in order to get closer to the target
state faster. Then you would use the structure you
obtained with this method to fine tune it down to a highly accurate RMS.</P>

<P>This page will first convert your structure to PDB format
using BABEL, and then process that structure with TINKER, first
converting it to Tinker's XYZ format, then running MINIMIZE and
finally converting TINKER output back to PDB format.</P>

<STRONG>Input:</STRONG> You must supply:
<UL>
    <LI>the <STRONG>coordinates</STRONG> of your molecule in 
any of BABEL supported
formats, either as a local file selected from your computer
or pasting the coordinate data in the supplied box.</LI>

    <LI>the input <STRONG>format</STRONG> of your data (make sure it matches
what you have or you may get entirely wrong results)</LI>

    <LI>the <A HREF="params.html"><STRONG>force field</STRONG></A> to use in the minimization procedure</LI>

    <LI>target <STRONG>RMS gradient</STRONG> value at which the minimization 
will terminate (in Kcal/mole/Angstrom)</LI>

   <LI><STRONG>Method</STRONG>: use Automatic unless you understand the math involved</LI>

   <LI><STRONG>Precondition</STRONG>: use Auto unless you understand the math involved</LI>

   <LI>an <STRONG>e-mail address</STRONG> where the results (see below) will 
be sent</LI>
    
    <LI>an optional <STRONG>urgent-mail address</STRONG> (e.g. a WAP mobile 
phone) where a short notification may be sent (so you may know it's done 
ASAP)</LI>
    
    <LI>a <STRONG>short title</STRONG> to identify your job (this is for your own reference
purposes, so you can identify the results when they are mailed to you)</LI>
</UL></P>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="lightpink">

<P><STRONG>Output</STRONG> will be sent to you by e-mail at the specified address. It
will consist of several files:
<UL>
    <LI>[LOG] the minimization  statistics 
    <LI>[XYZ] the minimized structure in TINKER XYZ format
    <LI>[PDB] the minimized structure in PDB format
    <LI>[SEQ] the sequence corresponding to your structure
</UL></P>
<P>You may also specify an additional e-mail address to receive
a short notification. Typically this would be a mobile phone e-mail
address. This way, if your results are important to you, you will
be notified of program termination as soon as possible.</P>
