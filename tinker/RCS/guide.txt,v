 1.     Introduction to the TINKER Package

     Welcome to the TINKER molecular modeling package!  
TINKER is designed to be an easily used and flexible system 
of programs and routines for molecular mechanics and 
dynamics as well as other energy-based and structural 
manipulation calculations. It is intended to be modular 
enough to enable development of new computational methods 
and efficient enough to meet most "production" calculation 
needs. Rather than incorporating all the functionality in 
one monolithic program, TINKER provides a set of relatively 
small programs that interoperate to perform complex 
computations. New programs can be easily added by modelers 
with only limited programming experience. The series of 
major programs included in the distribution system perform 
the following core tasks:

           (1) energy minimization and structural 
optimization
           (2) analysis of energy distribution within a 
structure
           (3) molecular dynamics and stochastic dynamics
           (4) simulated annealing with a choice of cooling 
schedules
           (5) normal modes and vibrational frequencies
           (6) conformational search and global optimization
           (7) transition state location and conformational 
pathways
           (8) fitting of energy parameters to crystal data
           (9) distance geometry with pairwise metrization
          (10) molecular volumes and surface areas
          (11) free energy changes for structural mutations
          (12) advanced algorithms based on potential 
smoothing

     Many of the various energy minimization and molecular 
dynamics computations can be performed on full or partial 
structures, over Cartesian, internal or rigid body 
coordinates, and including a variety of boundary conditions 
and crystal cell types. Other programs are available to 
generate timing data and allow checking of potential 
function derivatives for coding errors.

     Due to its emphasis on ease of modification, TINKER 
differs from many other currently available molecular 
modeling packages in that the user is expected to be willing 
to write simple "front-end" programs and make some 
alterations at the source code level. The main programs 
provided should be considered as templates for the users to 
change according to their wishes. All subroutines are 
internally documented and structured programming practices 
are adhered to throughout. The result, it is hoped, will be 
a calculational system which can be tailored to local needs 
and desires.

     The core TINKER system consists of about 100,000 lines 
of source written entirely in a portable Fortran77 dialect. 
Use is made of only some very common extensions that aid in 
writing highly structured code. The current version of the 
package has been ported to a wide range of computers with no 
or extremely minimal changes. Tested machines include: 
Compaq Alphas under Tru64 Unix or OpenVMS; Hewlett-Packard, 
IBM RS/6000, Silicon Graphics and Sun workstations under the 
vendor's Unix; Apple Macintosh; and Intel PCs under 
Windows9X, WindowsNT or Linux. At present, our new code is 
written on Compaq Alpha platforms, and occasionally tested 
for compatibility on various of the machine and OS 
combinations listed above. At the present time, we are in 
the process of converting primary development efforts from 
FORTRAN77 to both Fortran90 and C/C++. A machine translated 
C version of TINKER is currently available, and a hand-
translated optimized C version in partially complete.

     The basic design of the energy function engine used by 
the TINKER system allows usage of several different 
parameter sets. At present we are distributing parameters 
that implement AMBER-95, CHARMM22, MM2, MM3, OPLS-AA, OPLS-
UA and our own TINKER parameters. In most cases, the source 
code separates the geometric manipulations needed for energy 
derivatives from the actual form of the energy function 
itself. Several other literature parameter sets are under 
development (ENCAD, MMFF-94, UFF, etc.), and many of the 
alternative potential function forms reported in the 
literature can be implemented directly or after minor code 
changes.

     Much of the software in the TINKER package has been 
heavily used and well tested, but some modules are still in 
a fairly early stage of development. Further work on the 
TINKER system is planned in three main areas: (1) extension 
and improvement of the potential energy parameters including 
further development of our polarizable multipole TINKER 
force field, (2) coding of new computational algorithms 
including additional methods for free energy determination, 
torsional Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics sampling, 
advanced methods for long range interactions, better 
transition state location, and further application of the 
potential smoothing paradigm, (3) a friendlier user 
interface for protein/nucleic acid/polysaccharide 
computations including direct input/output of Protein Data 
Bank files, and (4) a simple GUI front-end to tie together 
the TINKER programs using RasMol as a molecule viewer.

     Questions and comments regarding the TINKER package, 
including suggestions for improvements and changes should be

In addition, an Internet web site containing an online 
version of this User's Guide, the most recent distribution 
version of the full TINKER package and other useful 
information can be found at http://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker, 
the Home Page for the TINKER Molecular Modeling Package.
 2.     Installing TINKER on your Computer

     The TINKER package is distributed on the Internet via 
either the web site or the anonymous ftp account on 
dasher.wustl.edu with an IP number of 128.252.162.151. This 
node is an AlphaServer 4100 file and compute server running 
Compaq Tru64 Unix located in the Ponder lab at Washington 
University School of Medicine. After pointing to the home 
page or logging in under ftp (Username: anonymous, Password: 
"your email address"), the software may be found in the 
/pub/tinker subdirectory. The package is also available via 
the Web and standard browsers from the TINKER home page at 
http://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker/. The complete TINKER 
distribution as well as individual files can be downloaded 
from this site.

     On dasher.wustl.edu, the TINKER package is present as 
both a compressed Unix tar archive and as a complete set of 
uncompressed source and data files. Binaries are provided 
for Intel PCs running Windows 9X/NT, PCs running Linux, and 
for Apple Power Macintosh. All of these executables are 
available in standard compressed formats as individual 
programs or as complete sets of executables. It is expected 
that other Unix users and PC users who need specially 
customized versions, will build binaries for their specific 
system. Sites with access to the Unix tar and 
compress/uncompress commands should simply obtain the 
archive file "tinker.tar.Z". Alternatively, a file 
"tinker.tar.gz" compressed with GNU gzip is also provided. 
If you choose to download individual files, you will need at 
a minimum the contents of the /doc, /source and /params 
subdirectories. Also required are the compile/build scripts 
from the subdirectory named for your machine type. Other 
areas contain test cases and examples, benchmark results, 
and machine-translated C code. The entire TINKER package, 
after building the executables, requires about 40 to 60 
megabytes of disk space. This value can vary significantly 
from system to system, and depends in part on the 
availability and use of shared libraries.

     The documentation for the TINKER programs, including 
the guide you are currently reading, is located in the 
/pub/tinker/doc subdirectory. The documentation was prepared 
on Compaq Alpha workstations using the Applixware Words and 
Graphics programs. Portable versions of the documentation 
are provided as ascii text in the .txt files and in the .ps 
Postscript format files. Please read and return the TINKER 
license. While the intent is to distribute the TINKER code 
to anyone who wants it, the authors would like to keep track 
of the sites using the package. The returned license forms 
also help us justify further development of TINKER. When new 
modules and capabilities become available, and when the 
almost inevitable bugs are uncovered, we will attempt to 
notify all who have returned a license form. Finally, we 
remind you that this software is copyrighted, and ask that 
it not be redistributed in any form.

     The compilation and building of the TINKER executables 
should be easy for most of the common workstation and PC 
class computers. We provide in the /make area a Unix-style 
Makefile that with some modification can be used to build 
TINKER on most Unix machines. As a simpler alternative to 
Makefiles for the Unix versions, we also provide machine-
specific directories with three separate shell scripts to 
compile the source, build an object library, and link binary 
executables. Three similar command files are provided for 
Open VMS, and for PC and Macintosh systems. Compilation on 
Unix workstations should use the vendor supplied Fortran 
compiler, if available. The public domain GNU g77 Fortran 
compiler is also capable of building TINKER on Unix 
machines. TINKER can also be built with the egcs version of 
the GNU compilers available from http://egcs.cygnus.com/ for 
Linux and other Unix systems. The Linux executables we 
provide are built with the Absoft ProFortran for Linux 
compiler which generated somewhat faster executables than 
egcs. For the Macintosh we have favorable experience with 
the Absoft ProFortran compiler running under the Macintosh 
Programmers' Workbench (MPW). On IBM PC's running Windows 
9X/NT, the distributed TINKER executables are built under 
the Digital Visual Fortran 6.0 compiler. The Microsoft 
Fortran Power Station 4.0 and Watcom F77 compilers are also 
sufficient for building TINKER, and we provide scripts for 
all three of these PC compilers. Alternative PC compilers 
such as those from Lahey/Fujitsu and The Portland Group 
should work as well, but we have not evaluated them yet. 
Please see the README files in each of the machine-specific 
areas for further information.

     The first step in building TINKER using the script 
files is to run the appropriate "compile" script. Next you 
must use the "library" script to create an archive of object 
code modules. Finally, run the "link" script to produce the 
complete set of TINKER executables. The executables can be 
renamed and moved to wherever you like by editing and 
running the "rename" script.

     Regardless of your target machine, only three small 
pieces of code can possibly require attention prior to 
building. The first two are the system dependent time and 
date routines found in "clock.f" and "calendar.f" 
respectively. Please uncomment the sections of these 
routines needed for your computer type. The final set of 
source alterations are the master array dimensions found in 
the include file "sizes.i". The most basic limit is on the 
number of atoms allowed, "maxatm". This parameter can be set 
to 10000 or more on most workstations. Personal computers 
with minimal memory may need a lower limit, perhaps 1000 
atoms, depending on available memory, swap space and other 
resources. A description of the other parameter values is 
contained in the header of the file. Note that in order to 
keep the code completely transparent, TINKER does not 
implement any sort of virtual memory or heap data structure. 
This requires that "sizes.i" values be set at least as large 
as the biggest problem you intend to run. Obviously, you 
should not set the array sizes to unnecessarily large 
values, since this can tax your compute resources and may 
result in performance degradation. The worst case we know of 
at present is for some of the Alpha machines, where running 
a "small" problem with TINKER executables dimensioned to 
"large" sizes can result in a 25-50% CPU time penalty, 
especially if only the default compiler options are used.

     Specific questions about the building or use of the 
TINKER package should be directed to 
ponder@@dasher.wustl.edu. TINKER related questions or 
comments of more general interest can be sent to the 
Computational Chemistry List (http://www.ccl.net/) run by 
Jan Labanowski of The Ohio Supercomputer Center. The TINKER 
developers monitor this list and will respond to the list or 
the individual poster as appropriate. 
 3.     Types of Input & Output Files

     This section describes the basic file types used by the 
TINKER package. Let's say you wish to perform a calculation 
on a particular small organic molecule. Assume that the file 
name chosen for our input and output files is sample. Then 
all of the TINKER files will reside on the computer under 
the name sample.xxx where .xxx is any of the several 
extension types to be described below.

SAMPLE.XYZ

The .xyz file is the basic TINKER Cartesian coordinates file 
type. It contains a title line followed by one line for each 
atom in the structure. Each line contains: the sequential 
number within the structure, an atomic symbol or name, X-, 
Y-, and Z-coordinates, the force field atom type number of 
the atom, and a list of the atoms connected to the current 
atom. Except for programs whose basic operation is in 
torsional space, all TINKER calculations are done from some 
version of the .xyz format.

SAMPLE.INT

The .int file contains an internal coordinates 
representation of the molecular structure. It consists of a 
title line followed by one line for each atom in the 
structure. Each line contains: the sequential number within 
the structure, an atomic symbol or name, the force field 
atom type number of the atom, and internal coordinates in 
the usual Z-matrix format. For each atom the internal 
coordinates consist of a distance to some previously defined 
atom, and either two bond angles or a bond angle and a 
dihedral angle to previous atoms. The length, angle and 
dihedral definitions do not have to represent "real" bonded 
interactions. Following the last atom definition are two 
optional blank line separated sets of atom number pairs. The 
first list contains pairs of atoms that are covalently 
bonded, but whose bond length was not used as part of the 
atom definitions. These pairs are typically used to close 
ring structures. The second list contains "bonds" that are 
to be broken, i.e., pairs of atoms that are not covalently 
bonded, but which were used to define a distance in the atom 
definitions.

SAMPLE.KEY

The keyword parameter file always has the extension .key and 
is optionally present during TINKER calculations. It 
contains values for any of a wide variety of switches and 
parameters that are used to change the course of the 
computation from the default. The detailed contents of this 
file is explained in a latter section of this User's Guide. 
If a molecular system specific keyfile, in this case 
sample.key, is not present, the the TINKER program will look 
in the same directory for a generic file named tinker.key.

SAMPLE.DYN

The .dyn file contains values needed to restart a molecular 
or stochastic dynamics computation. It stores the current 
position, current velocity and current and previous 
accelerations for each atom, as well as the size and shape 
of any periodic box or crystal unit cell. This information 
can be used to start a new dynamics run from the final state 
of a previous run. Upon startup, the dynamics programs 
always check for the presence of a .dyn file and make use of 
it whenever possible. The .dyn file is updated concurrent 
with the saving of a new dynamics trajectory snapshot.

SAMPLE.END

The .end file type provides a mechanism to gracefully stop a 
running TINKER calculation. At appropriate checkpoints 
during a calculation, TINKER will test for the presence of a 
sample.end file, and if found will terminate the calculation 
after updating the output. The .end file can be created at 
any time during a computation, and will be detected when the 
next checkpoint is reached. The file may be of zero size, 
and its contents are unimportant. In the current version of 
TINKER, the .end mechanism is only available within 
dynamics-based programs.

SAMPLE.001, SAMPLE.002, ....

Several types of computations produce files containing a 
three or more digit extension (.001 as shown; or .002, .137, 
.5678, etc.). These are referred to as cycle files, and are 
used to store various types of output structures. The cycle 
files from a given computation are identical in internal 
structure to either the .xyz or .int files described above. 
For example, the vibrational analysis program can save the 
tenth normal mode in sample.010. A molecular dynamics-based 
program might save its tenth 0.1 picosecond frame (or an 
energy minimizer its tenth partially minimized intermediate) 
in a file of the same name.

SAMPLE.ARC

A TINKER archive file is simply a series of .xyz Cartesian 
coordinate files appended together one after another. This 
file can be used to condense the results from intermediate 
stages of an optimization, frames from a molecular dynamics 
trajectory, or set of normal mode vibrations into a single 
file for storage.

SAMPLE.PDB

This file type contains coordinate information in the PDB 
format developed by the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank for 
deposition of model structures based on macromolecular X-ray 
diffraction and NMR data. Although TINKER itself does not 
use .pdb files directly for input/output, auxiliary programs 
are provided with the system for interconverting .pdb files 
with the .xyz format described above.

SAMPLE.SEQ

This file type contains the primary sequence of a biopolymer 
in a form compatible with the University of Wisconsin GCG 
package. An .seq file is generated automatically when a PDB 
file is converted to TINKER .xyz format, and is required for 
the reverse conversion.

SAMPLE.FRAC

The fractional coordinates corresponding to the asymmetric 
unit of a crystal unit cell are stored in the .frac file. 
The internal format of this file is identical to the .xyz 
file; except that the coordinates are fractional instead of 
in Angstrom units.

SAMPLE.XMOL

The ARCHIVE program has the option of converting a series of 
.xyz cycle files into an XMOL XYZ file. These files can be 
displayed as a movie using the MSC XMOL display program. 
Note that the .xmol file format does not contain TINKER atom 
type information, so it is not possible to convert an .xmol 
file back into a TINKER .xyz file.

SAMPLE.BIOS

The ARCHIVE program has the option of converting a series of 
.xyz cycle files into a BIOSYM InsightII coordinate archive 
file. These files can be displayed as a movie using the 
InsightII display program. Note that the .bios file format 
does not contain TINKER atom type information, so it is not 
possible to convert a .bios file back into a TINKER .XYZ 
file.

PARAMETER FILES

The potential energy parameter files distributed with the 
TINKER package all end in the extension .prm, although this 
is not required by the programs themselves. Each of these 
files contains a definition of the potential energy 
functional forms for that force field as well as values for 
individual energy parameters. For example, the mm3pro.prm 
file contains the energy parameters and definitions needed 
for a protein-specific version of the MM3 force field.
 4.     Potential Energy Programs

     This section of the manual contains a brief description 
of each of the TINKER potential energy programs. A detailed 
example showing how to run each program is included in a 
later section.

ALCHEMY

A simple program to perform very basic free energy 
perturbation calculations. This program is provided mostly 
for demonstration purposes; a more general and sophisticated 
version is currently under development in our group. The 
present version uses the perturbation formula and windowing 
with an explicit mapping of atoms involved in the mutation 
("AMBER"-style), instead of thermodynamic integration and 
independent freely propagating groups of mutated atoms 
("CHARMM"-style). Some of the code specific to this program 
is limited to OPLS potentials, but could be easily 
generalized to handle other functional forms. In St. Louis, 
we use ALCHEMY in molecular modeling course laboratory 
exercises to perform such classic mutations as chloride to 
bromide and ethane to methanol in water.

ANALYZE

Provides information about a specific molecular structure. 
The program will ask for the name of a structure file, which 
must be in the TINKER .xyz file format, and the type of 
analysis desired. Options allow output of:  (1) total 
potential energy of the system, (2) breakdown of the energy 
by potential function type or over individual atoms, (3) 
computation of the total dipole moment and its components, 
moments of inertia and radius of gyration, (4) listing of 
the parameters used to compute selected interaction 
energies, (5) energies associated with specified individual 
interactions.

ANNEAL

Performs a molecular dynamics simulated annealing 
computation. The program starts from a specified input 
molecular structure in TINKER .xyz format. The trajectory is 
updated using either a modified Beeman or a velocity Verlet 
integration method. The annealing protocol is implemented by 
allowing smooth changes between starting and final values of 
the system temperature via the Groningen method of coupling 
to an external bath. The scaling can be linear or sigmoidal 
in nature. In addition, parameters such as cutoff distance 
can be transformed along with the temperature. The user must 
input the desired number of dynamics steps for both the 
equilibration and cooling phases, a time interval for the 
dynamics steps, and an interval between 
coordinate/trajectory saves. All saved coordinate sets along 
the trajectory are placed in sequentially numbered cycle 
files.

DYNAMIC

Performs a molecular dynamics (MD) or stochastic dynamics 
(SD) computation. Starts either from a specified input 
molecular structure (an .xyz file) or from a structure-
velocity-acceleration set saved from a previous dynamics 
trajectory (a restart from a .dyn file). MD trajectories are 
propagated using either a modified Beeman or a velocity 
Verlet integration method. SD is implemented via our own 
derivation of a velocity Verlet-based algorithm. In addition 
the program can perform full crystal calculations, and can 
operate in constant energy mode or with maintenance of a 
desired temperature and/or pressure using the Groningen 
method of coupling to external baths. The user must input 
the desired number of dynamics steps, a time interval for 
the dynamics steps, and an interval between 
coordinate/trajectory saves. Coordinate sets along the 
trajectory can be saved as sequentially numbered cycle files 
or directly to a TINKER archive .arc file. At the same time 
that a point along the trajectory is saved, the complete 
information needed to restart the trajectory from that point 
is updated and stored in the .dyn file.

GDA

A program to implement Straub's Gaussian Density Annealing 
algorithm over an effective series of analytically smoothed 
potential energy surfaces. This method can be viewed as an 
extended stochastic version of the diffusion equation method 
of Scheraga, et al., and also has many similar features to 
the TINKER Potential Smoothing and Search (PSS) series of 
programs. The current version of GDA is similar to but does 
not exactly reproduce Straub's published method and is 
limited to argon clusters and other simple systems involving 
only van der Waals interactions; further modification and 
development of this code is currently underway in the Ponder 
research group. As with other programs involving potential 
smoothing, GDA currently requires use of the smooth.prm 
force field parameters.

MINIMIZE

Performs a nonlinear conjugate gradient minimization of an 
input structure over Cartesian coordinates. The method 
requires only the potential energy and gradient at each step 
along the minimization pathway. It requires storage space 
proportional to the number of atoms in the structure. The 
MINIMIZE procedure is recommended for preliminary 
minimization of trial structures to an RMS gradient of 1.0 
to 0.1 kcal/mole/Ang. It has a relatively fast cycle time 
and is tolerant of poor initial structures, but converges 
very slowly (linearly) once near the minimum. The user 
supplies the name of the TINKER .xyz coordinates file and a 
target RMS gradient value at which the minimization will 
terminate. Output consists of minimization statistics 
written to the screen or redirected to an output file, and 
the new coordinates written to updated .xyz files or to 
cycle files.

MINIROT

This program uses the same nonlinear conjugate gradient 
method as MINIMIZE, but performs the computation in terms of 
dihedral angles instead of Cartesian coordinates. Output is 
saved in an updated .int file or in cycle files.

NEWTON

A truncated Newton minimization method which requires 
potential energy, gradient and Hessian information. This 
procedure has significant advantages over standard Newton 
methods, and is able to minimize very large structures 
completely. Several options are provided with respect to 
minimization method and preconditioning of the Newton 
equations. The default options are recommended unless the 
user is familiar with the math involved. This program 
operates in Cartesian coordinate space and is fairly 
tolerant of poor input structures. Typical algorithm 
iteration times are longer than with nonlinear conjugate 
gradient or variable metric methods, but many fewer 
iterations are required for complete minimization. NEWTON is 
usually the best choice for minimizations to the 0.01 to 
0.000001 kcal/mole/Ang level of RMS gradient convergence. 
Tests for directions of negative curvature can be removed, 
allowing NEWTON to be used for optimization to 
conformational transition state structures (this only works 
if the starting point is very "close" to the transition 
state). Input consists of a TINKER .xyz coordinates file; 
output is an updated set of minimized coordinates and 
minimization statistics.

NEWTROT

The NEWTROT program is similar to NEWTON except that it 
requires a .int file as input and then operates in terms of 
dihedral angles as the minimization variables. Since the 
dihedral space Hessian matrix of an arbitrary structure is 
often indefinite, this method will often not perform as well 
as the other, simpler dihedral angle based minimizers.

OPTIMIZE

This is a variable metric energy minimization program which 
operates on Cartesian coordinates (an .xyz file). The method 
requires computation of energies and gradients as well as 
storage for an estimate of the Hessian matrix. OPTIMIZE will 
typically converge somewhat faster and more completely than 
MINIMIZE. However, the need to store and manipulate a full 
inverse Hessian estimate limits its use to structures 
containing less than a few hundred atoms on workstation 
class machines. As with the other minimizers, OPTIMIZE needs 
input coordinates and an RMS gradient cutoff criterion. The 
output coordinates are saved in updated .xyz files or as 
cycle files.

OPTIROT

The OPTIROT program is similar to OPTIMIZE except that it 
operates on dihedral angles starting from a TINKER .int 
internal coordinate file. This program is usually the 
preferred method for most dihedral angle optimization 
problems since Truncated Newton methods appear, in our 
hands, to lose some of their efficacy in moving from 
Cartesian to torsional coordinates.

OPTRIGID

The OPTRIGID program is similar to OPTIMIZE except that it 
operates on rigid bodies starting from a TINKER .xyz 
coordinate file and the rigid body group definitions found 
in the corresponding .key file. Output is saved in an 
updated .xyz file or in cycle files.

PATH

A program that implements a variant of Elber's Lagrangian 
multiplier-based reaction path following algorithm. The 
program takes as input a pair of structural minima as TINKER 
.xyz files, and then generates a user specified number of 
points along a path through conformational space connecting 
the input structures. The intermediate structures are output 
as TINKER cycle files, and the higher energy intermediates 
can be used as input to a Newton-based optimization to 
locate conformational transition states.

PSS

Implements our version of a potential smoothing and search 
algorithm for the "global" optimization of molecular 
conformation. An initial structure in .xyz format is first 
minimized in Cartesian coordinates on a series of 
increasingly smoothed potential energy surfaces. Then the 
smoothing procedure is reversed with minimization on each 
successive surface starting from the coordinates of the 
minimum on the previous surface. A local search procedure is 
used during the backtracking to explore for alternative 
minima better than the one found during the current 
minimization. The final result is usually a very low energy 
conformation or, in favorable cases, the global energy 
minimum conformation. The minimum energy coordinate sets 
found on each surface during both the forward smoothing and 
backtracking procedures are placed in sequentially numbered 
cycle files.

PSSRIGID

This program implements the potential smoothing and search 
method as described above for PSS, but performs the 
computation in terms of keyfile-defined rigid body atom 
groups instead of Cartesian coordinates. Output is saved in 
numbered cycle files with the .xyz file format.

PSSROT

This program implements the potential smoothing and search 
method as described above for PSS, but performs the 
computation in terms of dihedral angles instead of Cartesian 
coordinates. Output is saved in numbered cycle files with 
the .int file format.

SADDLE

A program for the location of a conformational transition 
state between two potential energy minima. SADDLE uses a 
conglomeration of ideas from the Bell-Crighton quadratic 
path and the Halgren-Lipscomb synchronous transit methods. 
The basic idea is to perform a nonlinear conjugate gradient 
optimization in a subspace orthogonal to a suitably defined 
"reaction coordinate". The program requires as input the 
coordinates (TINKER .xyz files) of the two minima and an RMS 
gradient convergence criterion for the optimization. The 
current estimate of the transition state structure is 
written to the file TSTATE.XYZ. Crude transition state 
structures generated by SADDLE can sometimes be refined 
using the NEWTON program. Optionally, a scan of the 
interconversion pathway can be made at each major iteration.

SCAN

A program for general conformational search of an entire 
potential energy surface via a basin hopping method. The 
program takes as input a TINKER .xyz coordinates file which 
is then minimized to find the first local minimum for a 
search list. A series of activations along various normal 
modes from this initial minimum are used as seed points for 
additional minimizations. Whenever a previously unknown 
local minimum is located it is added to the search list. 
When all minima on the search list have been subjected to 
the normal mode activation without locating additional new 
minima, the program terminates. The individual local minima 
are written to cycle files as they are discovered. While the 
SCAN program can be used on standard ``undeformed'' 
potential energy surfaces, we have found it to be highly 
effective at quickly ``scanning'' a smoothed energy surface 
to enumerate the major basins of attraction spaning the 
entire surface.

SNIFFER

A program that implements the Sniffer global optimization 
algorithm of Butler and Slaminka, a discrete version of 
Griewank's global search trajectory method. The program 
takes an input TINKER .xyz coordinates file and shakes it 
vigorously via a modified dynamics trajectory before, 
hopefully, settling into a low lying minimum. Some trial and 
error is often required as the current implementation is 
sensitive to various parameters and tolerances that govern 
the computation. At present, these parameters are not user 
accessible, and must be altered in the source code. However, 
this method can do a good job of quickly optimizing 
conformation within a limited range of convergence.

TIMER

A simple program to provide timing statistics for energy 
function calls within the TINKER package. TIMER requires an 
input .xyz file and outputs the CPU time (wall clock time on 
some machine types) needed to perform a specified number of 
energy, gradient and Hessian evaluations.

TIMEROT

This program is similar to TIMER, only it operates over 
dihedral angles via input of a TINKER .int internal 
coordinate file. In the current version, the torsional 
Hessian is computed numerically from the analytical 
torsional gradient.

TESTGRAD

The TESTGRAD program computes and compares the analytical 
and numerical first derivatives (i.e., the gradient vector) 
of the potential energy for a Cartesian coordinate input 
structure. The output can be used to test or debug the 
current potential or any added user defined energy terms.

TESTHESS

The TESTHESS program computes and compares the analytical 
and numerical second derivatives (i.e., the Hessian matrix) 
of the potential energy for a Cartesian coordinate input 
structure. The output can be used to test or debug the 
current potential or any added user defined energy terms.

TESTLIGHT

A program to compare the efficiency of different nonbonded 
neighbor methods for the current molecular system. The 
program times the computation of energy and gradient for the 
van der Waals and charge-charge electrostatic potential 
terms using a simple double loop over all interactions and 
using the "method of lights" algorithm to select neighbors. 
The results can be used to decide whether the "method of 
lights" has any CPU time advantage for the current 
structure. Both methods should give exactly the same answer 
in all cases, since the identical individual interactions 
are computed by both methods. The default double loop method 
is faster when cutoffs are not used, or when the cutoff 
sphere contains about half or more of the total system of 
unit cell. In cases where the cutoff sphere is much smaller 
than the system size, the "method of lights" can be much 
faster since it avoids unnecessary calculation of distances 
beyond the cutoff range.

TESTROT

The TESTROT program computes and compares the analytical and 
numerical first derivatives (i.e., the gradient vector) of 
the potential energy with respect to dihedral angles. Input 
is a TINKER .int internal coordinate file. The output can be 
used to test or debug the current potential or any added 
user defined energy terms.

VIBRATE

A program to perform vibrational analysis by computing and 
diagonalizing the full Hessian matrix (i.e., the second 
partial derivatives) for an input structure (a TINKER .xyz 
file). Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the mass weighted 
Hessian (i.e., the vibrational frequencies and normal modes) 
are also calculated. Structures corresponding to individual 
normal mode motions can be saved in cycle files.

VIBROT

The program VIBROT forms the torsional Hessian matrix via 
numerical differentiation of the analytical torsional 
gradient. The Hessian is then diagonalized and the 
eigenvalues are output. The present version does not compute 
the kinetic energy matrix elements needed to convert the 
Hessian into the torsional normal modes; this will be added 
in a later version. The required input is a TINKER .int 
internal coordinate file.

XTALFIT

The XTALFIT program is of use in the automated fitting of 
potential parameters to crystal structure and thermodynamic 
data. XTALFIT takes as input several crystal structures 
(TINKER .xyz files with unit cell parameters in 
corresponding keyfiles) as well as information on lattice 
energies and dipole moments of monomers. The current version 
uses a nonlinear least squares optimization to fit van der 
Waals and electrostatic parameters to the input data. Bounds 
can be placed on the values of the optimization parameters.

XTALMIN

A program to perform full crystal minimizations. The program 
takes as input the structure coordinates and unit cell 
lattice parameters. It then alternates cycles of Newton-
style optimization of the structure and conjugate gradient 
optimization of the crystal lattice parameters. This 
alternating minimization is slower than more direct 
optimization of all parameters at once, but is somewhat more 
robust in our hands. The symmetry of the original crystal is 
not enforced, so interconversion of crystal forms may be 
observed in some cases.
 5.     Structure Manipulation Programs

     This section of the manual contains a brief description 
of each of the TINKER structure manipulation, geometric 
calculation and auxiliary programs. A detailed example 
showing how to run each program is included in a later 
section.

ARCHIVE

A program for concatenating TINKER cycle files into a single 
archive file; useful for storing the intermediate results of 
minimizations, dynamics trajectories, and so on. The archive 
file can be written in TINKER format, or in formats usable 
with BIOSYM's InsightII (a CAR file) or with MSC's XMOL 
(their XYZ format). Only active atoms are written the the 
InsightII and XMOL style files, allowing display of partial 
structures. The program can also extract individual cycle 
files from a TINKER archive.

CORRELATE

A program to compute time correlation functions from 
collections of TINKER cycle files. Its use requires a user 
supplied function PROPERTY that computes the value of the 
property for which a time correlation is desired for two 
input structures. The main body of the program organizes the 
overall computation in an efficient manner and outputs the 
final time correlation function.

CRYSTAL

A program for the interconversion of fractional and 
Cartesian coordinates, generation of the unit cells from an 
asymmetric unit, and building a "macro" crystal from a 
single unit cell. The present version can handle about 25 of 
the most common space groups, others can easily be added as 
needed by modification of the routine SYMMETRY.

DISTGEOM

A program to perform distance geometry calculations using 
variations on the classic metric matrix method. A user 
specified number of structures consistent with keyfile input 
distance and dihedral restraints is generated. Bond length 
and angle restraints are derived from the input structure. 
Trial distances between the triangle smoothed lower and 
upper bounds can be chosen via any of several metrization 
schemes. The correct "size" of the structure is 
automatically maintained by choosing trial distances from 
Gaussian distributions of appropriate mean and width. The 
initial embedded structures can be further refined against a 
geometric restraint-only potential using either a sequential 
minimization protocol or simulated annealing.

INTEDIT

A program to allow interactive inspection and alteration of 
the internal coordinate definitions and values of a TINKER 
structure. If the structure is altered, the user has the 
option to write out a new internal coordinates file upon 
exit.

INTXYZ

A program to convert a TINKER .int internal coordinates 
formatted file into a TINKER .xyz Cartesian coordinates 
formatted file.

DOCUMENT

The DOCUMENT program is provided as a minimal listing and 
documentation tool. It operates on the TINKER source code, 
either individual files or the complete source listing 
produced by the command script "listing.make", to generate 
lists of routines, common blocks or valid keywords. In 
addition, the program has the ability to output a formatted 
parameter listing from the standard TINKER parameter files.

PDBXYZ

A program for converting a Brookhaven Protein Data Bank file 
(a PDB file) into a TINKER .xyz Cartesian coordinate file. 
If the PDB file contains only protein/peptide amino acid 
residues, then standard protein connectivity is assumed, and 
transferred to the XYZ file. For non-protein portions of the 
PDB file, atom connectivity is determined by the program 
based on interatomic distances. The program also has the 
ability to add or remove hydrogen atoms from a protein as 
required by the force field specified during the 
computation.

PROTEIN

A program for automated building of peptide and protein 
structures. Upon interactive input of an amino acid sequence 
with optional phi/psi/omega/chi angles, D/L chirality, etc., 
the program builds internal and Cartesian coordinates. 
Standard bond lengths and angles are assumed for the 
peptide. The program will optionally convert the structure 
to a cyclic peptide, or add either or both N- and C-terminal 
capping groups. The final coordinates and a sequence file 
are produced as the output.

SPACEFILL

A program to compute the volume and surface areas of 
molecules. Using a modified version of Connolly's original 
analytical description of the molecular surface, the program 
determines either the van der Waals, accessible or molecular 
(contact/reentrant) volume and surface area. Both surface 
area and volume are broken down into their geometric 
components, and surface area is decomposed into the convex 
contribution for each individual atom. The probe radius is 
input as a user option, and atomic radii can be set via the 
keyword file.

SUPERPOSE

A program to superimpose two molecular structures in 3-
dimensions. A variety of options for input of the atom sets 
to be used during the superposition are presented 
interactively to the user. The superposition can be mass-
weighted if desired, and the coordinates of the second 
structure superimposed on the first structure are optionally 
output.

SYBYLXYZ

A program for converting a TRIPOS Sybyl MOL2 file into a 
TINKER .xyz Cartesian coordinate file. The current version 
of the program does not attempt to convert the Sybyl atoms 
types into the active TINKER force field types, i.e., all 
atoms types are simply set to zero.

XYZINT

A program for converting a TINKER .xyz Cartesian coordinate 
formatted file into a TINKER .int internal coordinates 
formatted file.

XYZEDIT

A program that performs and of a variety of manipulations on 
an input TINKER .xyz Cartesian coordinates formatted file. 
The present version of the program has the following 
interactively selectable options: (1) Renumber All of the 
Current Atoms, (2) Deletion of Individual Specified Atoms, 
(3) Deletion of Specified Types of Atoms, (4) Deletion of 
Atoms outside Cutoff Range, (5) Insertion of Individual 
Specified Atoms, (6) Replace Old Atom Type with a New Type, 
(7) Assign Connectivities based on Distance, (8) Convert 
Units from Bohrs to Angstroms, (9) Invert thru Origin to 
give Mirror Image, (10) Translate Center of Mass to the 
Origin, (11) Translate a Specified Atom to the Origin, (12) 
Create a Periodic Boundary Box, (13) Soak Current Molecule 
in Box of Solvent, (14) Append another XYZ file to Current 
One. In most cases, multiply options can be applied 
sequentially to an input file. At the end of the editing 
process, a new version of the original .xyz file is written 
as output.

XYZPDB

A program for converting a TINKER .xyz Cartesian coordinate 
file into a Brookhaven Protein Data Bank file (a PDB file).

XYZSYBYL

A program to convert a TINKER .xyz Cartesian coordinates 
file into a TRIPOS Sybyl MOL2 file. The conversion generates 
only the MOLECULE, ATOM, BOND and SUBSTRUCTURE record type 
in the MOL2 file. Generic Sybyl atom types are used in most 
cases; while these atom types may need to be altered in some 
cases, Sybyl is usually able to correctly display the 
resulting MOL2 file.
 6.     Force Field Parameter Sets

     The TINKER package is distributed with several force 
field parameter sets, implementing a selection of widely-
used literature force fields as well as the TINKER force 
field currently under construction in the Ponder lab. We try 
to exactly reproduce the intent of the original authors of 
our distributed, third-party force fields. In all cases the 
parameter sets have been validated against literature 
reports, results provided by the original developers, or 
calculations made with the authentic programs. With the few 
exceptions noted below, TINKER calculations can be treated 
as authentic results from the genuine force fields. A brief 
description of each parameter set, including some still in 
preparation and not distributed with the current version, is 
provided below with lead references:

AMBER.PRM

AMBER-95 parameters for proteins. The nucleic acid 
parameters are not implemented yet. Note that with their 
``Cornell'' force field, the Kollman group has devised 
separate, fully independent partial charge values for each 
of the N- and C-terminal residues. At present, the terminal 
residue charges for TINKER's version maintain the correct 
formal charge, but redistributed somewhat from the Kollman 
group values. The file reproduces the authentic parm94 set; 
torsional parameter changes for parm96 are noted in that 
section of the file.

 7.     Use of the Keyword Control File

     This section contains a description of the keyword 
parameters which may be used to define or alter the course 
of a TINKER calculation. The keyword control file is 
optional in the sense that all of the TINKER programs will 
run in the absence of a keyfile and will simply use default 
values or query the user for needed information. However, 
the keywords allow use of a wide variety of algorithmic and 
procedural options, many of which are unavailable 
interactively.

     Keywords are read from the keyword control file. All 
programs look first for a keyfile with the same base name as 
the input molecular system and ending in the extension .key. 
If this file does not exist, then TINKER tries to use a 
generic keyfile with the name tinker.key and located in the 
same directory as the input system. If neither a system 
specific nor a generic keyfile is present, TINKER will 
continue by using default values for keyword options and 
asking interactive questions as necessary.

     TINKER searches the keyfile during the course of a 
calculation for relevant keywords that may be present. All 
keywords must appear as the first word on the line. Any 
blank space to the left of the keyword is ignored, and all 
contents of the keyfiles are case insensitive. Some keywords 
take modifiers; i.e., TINKER looks further on the same line 
for additional information, such as the value of some 
parameter related to the keyword. Modifier information is 
read in free format, but must be completely contained on the 
same line as the original keyword. Any lines contained in 
the keyfile which do not qualify as valid keyword lines are 
treated as comments and are simply ignored.

     Several keywords take a list of integer values (atom 
numbers, for example) as modifiers. For these keywords the 
integers can simply be listed explicitly and separated by 
spaces, commas or tabs. If a range of numbers is desired, it 
can be specified by listing the negative of the first number 
of the range, followed by a separator and the last number of 
the range. For example, the keyword line "ACTIVE 4 -9 17 23" 
could be used to add atoms 4, 9 through 17, and 23 to the 
set of active atoms during a TINKER calculation.

     Listed below are the valid TINKER keywords sorted into 
groups by general function. The section ends with an 
alphabetical listing of the individual keywords along with 
brief descriptions of their action and possible modifiers, 
and examples of usage.

Description of Individual Keywords

The following is an alphabetical list of the TINKER keywords 
along with a brief description of the action of each keyword 
and required or optional parameters that can be used to 
extend or modify each keyword. The form of possible 
modifiers, if any, is shown in brackets following each 
keyword.

A-AXIS [real]     Sets the value of the a-axis length for a 
crystal unit cell, or, equivalently,  the X-axis length for 
a periodic box. The length value in Angstroms is listed 
after the keyword.

A-EXPTERM [real]     Sets the value of the "A" premultiplier 
term in the Buckingham van der Waals function, i.e., the 
value of A in the formula Evdw = e { A exp[-B(Ro/R)] - C 
(Ro/R)6 }.

ACTIVE [integer list]     Sets the list of active atoms 
during a TINKER computation. Individual potential energy 
terms are computed when at least one atom involved in the 
term is active. For Cartesian space calculations, active 
atoms are those allowed to move. For torsional space 
calculations, rotations are allowed when all atoms on one 
side of the rotated bond are active. Multiple ACTIVE lines 
can be present in the keyfile and are treated cumulatively.  
On each line the keyword can be followed by one or more atom 
numbers or atom ranges. The presence of any ACTIVE keyword 
overrides any INACTIVE keywords in the keyfile.

ALPHA [real]     Sets the value of the a angle of a crystal 
unit cell, i.e., the angle between the b-axis and c-axis of 
a unit cell, or, equivalently, the angle between the Y-axis 
and Z-axis of a periodic box. The default value in the 
absence of the ALPHA keyword is 90 degrees.

ANGANG [1 integer & 3 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for a single angle-angle cross term potential 
parameter.

ANGANGTERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of the 
angle-angle cross term potential energy. In the absence of a 
modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the 
potential. The NONE option turns off use of this potential 
energy term. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy 
terms except for this one.

ANGANGUNIT [real]     Sets the scale factor needed to 
convert the energy value computed by the angle-angle cross 
term potential into units of kcal/mole. The correct value is 
force field dependent and typically provided in the header 
of the master force field parameter file. The default of 
(p/180)2 = 0.0003046 is used, if the ANGANGUNIT keyword is 
not given in the force field parameter file or the keyfile.

ANGLE [3 integers & 4 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for a single bond angle bending parameter. The 
integer modifiers give the atom class numbers for the three 
kinds of atoms involved in the angle which is to be defined. 
The real number modifiers give the force constant value for 
the angle and up to three ideal bond angles in degrees. In 
most cases only one ideal bond angle is given, and that 
value is used for all occurrences of the specified bond 
angle. If all three ideal angles are given, the values apply 
when the central atom of the angle is attached to 0, 1 or 2 
additional hydrogen atoms, respectively. This "hydrogen 
environment" option is provided to implement the 
corresponding feature of Allinger's MM force fields. The 
default units for the force constant are kcal/mole/radian2, 
but this can be controlled via the ANGLEUNIT keyword.

ANGLE-CUBIC [real]     Sets the value of the cubic term in 
the Taylor series expansion form of the bond angle bending 
potential energy. The real number modifier gives the value 
of the coefficient as a multiple of the quadratic 
coefficient. This term multiplied by the angle bending 
energy unit conversion factor, the force constant, and the 
cube of the deviation of the bond angle from its ideal value 
gives the cubic contribution to the angle bending energy. 
The default value in the absence of the ANGLE-CUBIC keyword 
is zero; i.e., the cubic angle bending term is omitted.

ANGLE-PENTIC [real]     Sets the value of the fifth power 
term in the Taylor series expansion form of the bond angle 
bending potential energy. The real number modifier gives the 
value of the coefficient as a multiple of the quadratic 
coefficient. This term multiplied by the angle bending 
energy unit conversion factor, the force constant, and the 
fifth power of the deviation of the bond angle from its 
ideal value gives the pentic contribution to the angle 
bending energy. The default value in the absence of the 
ANGLE-PENTIC keyword is zero; i.e., the pentic angle bending 
term is omitted.

ANGLE-QUARTIC [real]     Sets the value of the quartic term 
in the Taylor series expansion form of the bond angle 
bending potential energy. The real number modifier gives the 
value of the coefficient as a multiple of the quadratic 
coefficient. This term multiplied by the angle bending 
energy unit conversion factor, the force constant, and the 
forth power of the deviation of the bond angle from its 
ideal value gives the quartic contribution to the angle 
bending energy. The default value in the absence of the 
ANGLE-QUARTIC keyword is zero; i.e., the quartic angle 
bending term is omitted.

ANGLE-SEXTIC [real]     Sets the value of the sixth power 
term in the Taylor series expansion form of the bond angle 
bending potential energy. The real number modifier gives the 
value of the coefficient as a multiple of the quadratic 
coefficient. This term multiplied by the angle bending 
energy unit conversion factor, the force constant, and the 
sixth power of the deviation of the bond angle from its 
ideal value gives the sextic contribution to the angle 
bending energy. The default value in the absence of the 
ANGLE-SEXTIC keyword is zero; i.e., the sextic angle bending 
term is omitted.

ANGLE3 [3 integers & 4 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for a single bond angle bending parameter specific to 
atoms in 3-membered rings. The integer modifiers give the 
atom class numbers for the three kinds of atoms involved in 
the angle which is to be defined. The real number modifiers 
give the force constant value for the angle and up to three 
ideal bond angles in degrees. If all three ideal angles are 
given, the values apply when the central atom of the angle 
is attached to 0, 1 or 2 additional hydrogen atoms, 
respectively. The default units for the force constant are 
kcal/mole/radian2, but this can be controlled via the 
ANGLEUNIT keyword. If any ANGLE3 keywords are present, 
either in the master force field parameter file or the 
keyfile, then TINKER requires that special ANGLE3 parameters 
be given for all angles in 3-membered rings. In the absence 
of any ANGLE3 keywords, standard ANGLE parameters will be 
used for bonds in 3-membered rings.

ANGLE4 [3 integers & 4 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for a single bond angle bending parameter specific to 
atoms in 4-membered rings. The integer modifiers give the 
atom class numbers for the three kinds of atoms involved in 
the angle which is to be defined. The real number modifiers 
give the force constant value for the angle and up to three 
ideal bond angles in degrees. If all three ideal angles are 
given, the values apply when the central atom of the angle 
is attached to 0, 1 or 2 additional hydrogen atoms, 
respectively. The default units for the force constant are 
kcal/mole/radian2, but this can be controlled via the 
ANGLEUNIT keyword. If any ANGLE4 keywords are present, 
either in the master force field parameter file or the 
keyfile, then TINKER requires that special ANGLE4 parameters 
be given for all angles in 4-membered rings. In the absence 
of any ANGLE4 keywords, standard ANGLE parameters will be 
used for bonds in 4-membered rings.

ANGLE5 [3 integers & 4 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for a single bond angle bending parameter specific to 
atoms in 5-membered rings. The integer modifiers give the 
atom class numbers for the three kinds of atoms involved in 
the angle which is to be defined. The real number modifiers 
give the force constant value for the angle and up to three 
ideal bond angles in degrees. If all three ideal angles are 
given, the values apply when the central atom of the angle 
is attached to 0, 1 or 2 additional hydrogen atoms, 
respectively. The default units for the force constant are 
kcal/mole/radian2, but this can be controlled via the 
ANGLEUNIT keyword. If any ANGLE5 keywords are present, 
either in the master force field parameter file or the 
keyfile, then TINKER requires that special ANGLE5 parameters 
be given for all angles in 5-membered rings. In the absence 
of any ANGLE5 keywords, standard ANGLE parameters will be 
used for bonds in 5-membered rings.

ANGLEF [3 integers & 3 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for a single bond angle bending parameter for a 
SHAPES-style Fourier potential function. The integer 
modifiers give the atom class numbers for the three kinds of 
atoms involved in the angle which is to be defined. The real 
number modifiers give the force constant value for the 
angle, the angle shift in degrees, and the periodicity 
value. Note that the force constant should be given as the 
``harmonic'' value and not the native Fourier value. The 
default units for the force constant are kcal/mole/radian2, 
but this can be controlled via the ANGLEUNIT keyword.

ANGLETERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of the 
bond angle bending potential energy term. In the absence of 
a modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the 
potential. The NONE option turns off use of this potential 
energy term. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy 
terms except for this one.

ANGLEUNIT [real]     Sets the scale factor needed to convert 
the energy value computed by the bond angle bending 
potential into units of kcal/mole. The correct value is 
force field dependent and typically provided in the header 
of the master force field parameter file. The default value 
of (p/180)2 = 0.0003046 is used, if the ANGLEUNIT keyword is 
not given in the force field parameter file or the keyfile.

ANGMAX [real]     Set the maximum permissible angle between 
the current optimization search direction and the negative 
of the gradient direction. If this maximum angle value is 
exceeded, the optimization routine will note an error 
condition and may restart from the steepest descent 
direction. The default value in the absence of the ANGMAX 
keyword is usually 88 degrees for conjugate gradient methods 
and 180 degrees (i.e., disabled) for variable metric 
optimizations.

ARCHIVE     Causes TINKER molecular dynamics-based programs 
to write trajectories directly to a single archive file with 
the .arc format. If an archive file already exists at the 
start of the calculation, then the newly generated 
trajectory is appended to the end of the existing file. The 
default in the absence of this keyword is to write the 
trajectory snapshots to consecutively numbered cycle files.

ATOM [2 integers, name, quoted string, integer, real & 
integer]     This keyword provides the values needed to 
define a single force field atom type.

B-AXIS [real]     Sets the value of the b-axis length for a 
crystal unit cell, or, equivalently,  the Y-axis length for 
a periodic box. The length value in Angstroms is listed 
after the keyword. If the keyword is absent, the b-axis 
length is set equal to the a-axis length.

B-EXPTERM [real]     Sets the value of the "B" exponential 
factor in the Buckingham van der Waals function, i.e., the 
value of B in the formula Evdw = e { A exp[-B(Ro/R)] - C 
(Ro/R)6 }.

BASIN [2 reals]     Presence of this keyword turns on a 
"basin" restraint potential function that serves to drive 
the system toward a compact structure. The actual function 
is an exponential of the form Ebasin = S A exp[-B R], summed 
over all pairs of atoms where R is the distance between 
atoms. The A and B values are the depth and width parameters 
given as modifiers to the BASIN keyword. This potential is 
currently used to control the degree of expansion during 
potential energy smooth procedures through the use of 
shallow, broad basins.

BETA [real]     Sets the value of the b angle of a crystal 
unit cell, i.e., the angle between the a-axis and c-axis of 
a unit cell, or, equivalently, the angle between the X-axis 
and Z-axis of a periodic box. The default value in the 
absence of the BETA keyword is to set the b angle equal to 
the a angle as given by the keyword ALPHA.

BINARY     Causes TINKER molecular dynamics-based programs 
to write trajectories directly to a single archive file with 
a binary format. The default in the absence of this keyword 
is to write the trajectory to consecutively numbered cycle 
files or archive files in plain text ASCII format. Note this 
keyword is present in the code, but not active in TINKER 
version 3.7.

BIOTYPE [integer, name, quoted string & integer]     This 
keyword provides the values to define the correspondence 
between a single biopolymer atom type and its force field 
atom type.

BOND [2 integers & 2 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for a single bond stretching parameter. The integer 
modifiers give the atom class numbers for the two kinds of 
atoms involved in the bond which is to be defined. The real 
number modifiers give the force constant value for the bond 
and the ideal bond length in Å. The default units for the 
force constant are kcal/mole/Å2, but this can be controlled 
via the BONDUNIT keyword.

BOND-CUBIC [real]     Sets the value of the cubic term in 
the Taylor series expansion form of the bond stretching 
potential energy. The real number modifier gives the value 
of the coefficient as a multiple of the quadratic 
coefficient. This term multiplied by the bond stretching 
energy unit conversion factor, the force constant, and the 
cube of the deviation of the bond length from its ideal 
value gives the cubic contribution to the bond stretching 
energy. The default value in the absence of the BOND-CUBIC 
keyword is zero; i.e., the cubic bond stretching term is 
omitted.

BOND-QUARTIC [real]     Sets the value of the quartic term 
in the Taylor series expansion form of the bond stretching 
potential energy. The real number modifier gives the value 
of the coefficient as a multiple of the quadratic 
coefficient. This term multiplied by the bond stretching 
energy unit conversion factor, the force constant, and the 
forth power of the deviation of the bond length from its 
ideal value gives the quartic contribution to the bond 
stretching energy. The default value in the absence of the 
BOND-QUARTIC keyword is zero; i.e., the quartic bond 
stretching term is omitted.

BOND3 [2 integers & 2 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for a single bond stretching parameter specific to 
atoms in 3-membered rings. The integer modifiers give the 
atom class numbers for the two kinds of atoms involved in 
the bond which is to be defined. The real number modifiers 
give the force constant value for the bond and the ideal 
bond length in Å. The default units for the force constant 
are kcal/mole/Å2, but this can be controlled via the 
BONDUNIT keyword. If any BOND3 keywords are present, either 
in the master force field parameter file or the keyfile, 
then TINKER requires that special BOND3 parameters be given 
for all bonds in 3-membered rings. In the absence of any 
BOND3 keywords, standard BOND parameters will be used for 
bonds in 3-membered rings.

BOND4 [2 integers & 2 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for a single bond stretching parameter specific to 
atoms in 4-membered rings. The integer modifiers give the 
atom class numbers for the two kinds of atoms involved in 
the bond which is to be defined. The real number modifiers 
give the force constant value for the bond and the ideal 
bond length in Å. The default units for the force constant 
are kcal/mole/Å2, but this can be controlled via the 
BONDUNIT keyword. If any BOND4 keywords are present, either 
in the master force field parameter file or the keyfile, 
then TINKER requires that special BOND4 parameters be given 
for all bonds in 4-membered rings. In the absence of any 
BOND4 keywords, standard BOND parameters will be used for 
bonds in 4-membered rings

BOND5 [2 integers & 2 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for a single bond stretching parameter specific to 
atoms in 5-membered rings. The integer modifiers give the 
atom class numbers for the two kinds of atoms involved in 
the bond which is to be defined. The real number modifiers 
give the force constant value for the bond and the ideal 
bond length in Å. The default units for the force constant 
are kcal/mole/Å2, but this can be controlled via the 
BONDUNIT keyword. If any BOND5 keywords are present, either 
in the master force field parameter file or the keyfile, 
then TINKER requires that special BOND5 parameters be given 
for all bonds in 5-membered rings. In the absence of any 
BOND5 keywords, standard BOND parameters will be used for 
bonds in 5-membered rings

BONDTERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of the 
bond stretching potential energy term. In the absence of a 
modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the 
potential. The NONE option turns off use of this potential 
energy term. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy 
terms except for this one.

BONDTYPE [TAYLOR/MORSE/GAUSSIAN]     Chooses the functional 
form of the bond stretching potential. The TAYLOR option 
selects a Taylor series expansion containing terms from 
harmonic through quartic. The MORSE option selects a Morse 
potential fit to the ideal bond length and stretching force 
constant parameter values. The GAUSSIAN uses an inverted 
Gaussian with amplitude equal to the Morse "bond 
dissociation energy" and width set to reproduce the 
vibrational frequency of a harmonic potential. The default 
is to use the TAYLOR potential.

BONDUNIT [real]     Sets the scale factor needed to convert 
the energy value computed by the bond stretching potential 
into units of kcal/mole. The correct value is force field 
dependent and typically provided in the header of the master 
force field parameter file. The default value of 1.0 is 
used, if the BONDUNIT keyword is not given in the force 
field parameter file or the keyfile.

C-AXIS [real]     Sets the value of the C-axis length for a 
crystal unit cell, or, equivalently,  the Z-axis length for 
a periodic box. The length value in Angstroms is listed 
after the keyword. If the keyword is absent, the C-axis 
length is set equal to the A-axis length.

C-EXPTERM [real]     Sets the value of the "C" dispersion 
multiplier in the Buckingham van der Waals function, i.e., 
the value of C in the formula Evdw = e { A exp[-B(Ro/R)] - C 
(Ro/R)6 }.

CAPPA [real]     This keyword is used to set the normal 
termination criterion for the line search phase of TINKER 
optimization routines. The line search exits successfully if 
the ratio of the current gradient projection on the line to 
the projection at the start of the line search falls below 
the value of CAPPA. A default value of 0.1 is used in the 
absence of the CAPPA keyword.

CHARGE [1 integer & 1 real]     This keyword provides a 
value for a single atomic partial charge electrostatic 
parameter. The integer modifier, if positive, gives the atom 
type number for which the charge parameter is to be defined. 
Note that vdw parameters are given for atom types, not atom 
classes. If the integer modifier is negative, then the 
parameter value to follow applies only to the individual 
atom whose atom number is the negative of the modifier. The 
real number modifier gives the values of the atomic partial 
charge in electrons.

CHARGETERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of the 
charge-charge potential energy term between pairs of atomic 
partial charges. In the absence of a modifying option, this 
keyword turns on use of the potential. The NONE option turns 
off use of this potential energy term. The ONLY option turns 
off all potential energy terms except for this one.
 
CHG-12-USE [NONE]     This keyword determines whether the 
electrostatic potential energy terms will include 
interactions between 1-2 connected atoms, i.e., directly 
bonded atoms. In the absence of a modifying option, this 
keyword turns on 1-2 interactions reduced by a 
multiplicative factor supplied via the CHG-SCALE keyword. 
The NONE option turns off use of 1-2 interactions. The 
default in the absence of the CHG-12-USE keyword is to omit 
these interactions from the energy evaluation.
 
CHG-13-USE [NONE]     This keyword determines whether the 
electrostatic potential energy terms will include 
interactions between 1-3 connected atoms, i.e., atoms 
separated by 2 covalent bonds. In the absence of a modifying 
option, this keyword turns on 1-3 interactions reduced by a 
multiplicative factor supplied via the CHG-SCALE keyword. 
The NONE option turns off use of 1-3 interactions. The 
default in the absence of the CHG-13-USE keyword is to omit 
these interactions from the energy evaluation.
 
CHG-14-USE [NONE]     This keyword determines whether the 
electrostatic potential energy terms will include 
interactions between 1-4 connected atoms, i.e., atoms 
separated by 3 covalent bonds. In the absence of a modifying 
option, this keyword turns on 1-4 interactions reduced by a 
multiplicative factor supplied via the CHG-SCALE keyword. 
The NONE option turns off use of 1-4 interactions. The 
default in the absence of the CHG-14-USE keyword is to 
include these interactions in the energy evaluation.

CHG-CUTOFF [real]     Sets the cutoff distance value in 
Angstroms for simple charge-charge electrostatics and/or for 
atomic multipole potential energy interactions. The energy 
for any pair of sites beyond the cutoff distance will be set 
to zero. Other keywords can be used to select a smoothing 
scheme near the cutoff distance. The default cutoff distance 
in the absence of the CHG-CUTOFF keyword is essentially 
infinite for nonperiodic systems and 10.0 for periodic 
systems.

CHG-SCALE [real]     This keyword provides a scale factor by 
which charge-charge electrostatic interactions are reduced 
between neighboring atoms. The value associated with the 
CHG-SCALE keyword may be applied to 1-2, 1-3 and/or 1-4 
connected atom pairs as specified via the CHG-12-USE, CHG-
13-USE and CHG-14-USE keywords. The default value of 1.0 is 
used, if the CHG-SCALE keyword is not given in either the 
parameter file or the keyfile.

CHG-TAPER [real]     This keyword allows modification of the 
cutoff windows for simple charge-charge electrostatics 
and/or for atomic multipole potential energy interactions. 
It is similar in form and action to the TAPER keyword, 
except that its value applies only to the simple charge and 
multipole potentials. The default value in the absence of 
the CHG-TAPER keyword is to begin the cutoff window at 0.65 
of the corresponding cutoff distance.

CHGDPLTERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of the 
charge-dipole potential energy term between atomic partial 
charges and bond dipoles. In the absence of a modifying 
option, this keyword turns on use of the potential. The NONE 
option turns off use of this potential energy term. The ONLY 
option turns off all potential energy terms except for this 
one.

COMPRESS [real]     Sets the value of the bulk solvent 
isothermal compressibility in Atm-1 for use during pressure 
computation and scaling in molecular dynamics computations. 
The default value used in the absence of the COMPRESS 
keyword is 0.000046, appropriate for water. This parameter 
serves as a scale factor for the Groningen-style pressure 
bath coupling time, and its exact value should not be of 
critical importance.

CUTOFF [real]     Sets the cutoff distance value for all 
nonbonded potential energy interactions. The energy for any 
of the nonbonded potentials of a pair of sites beyond the 
cutoff distance will be set to zero. Other keywords can be 
used to select a smoothing scheme near the cutoff distance, 
or to apply different cutoff distances to various nonbonded 
energy terms.

DEBUG     Turns on printing of detailed information and 
intermediate values throughout the progress of a TINKER 
computation; not recommended for use with large structures 
or full potential energy functions since a summary of every 
individual interaction will usually be output.

DEFORM [real]     Sets the amount of diffusion equation-
style smoothing that will be applied to the potential energy 
surface when using the SMOOTH force field. The real number 
option is equivalent to the "time" value in the original 
Piela, et al. formalism; the larger the value, the greater 
the smoothing. The default value is zero, meaning that no 
smoothing will be applied.

DIELECTRIC [real]     Sets the value of the bulk dielectric 
constant used to damp all electrostatic interaction energies 
for any of the TINKER electrostatic potential functions. The 
default value is force field dependent, but is usually equal 
to 1.0 (for Allinger's MM force fields the default is 1.5).
  
DIFFUSE-ANGLE [real]     This keyword is used during 
potential function smoothing procedures to specify the 
effective diffusion coefficient to be applied to the 
smoothed form of the bond angle bending potential function. 
In the absence of the DIFFUSE-ANGLE keyword, a default value 
of 0.0014 is used.
 
DIFFUSE-BOND [real]     This keyword is used during 
potential function smoothing procedures to specify the 
effective diffusion coefficient to be applied to the 
smoothed form of the bond stretching potential function. In 
the absence of the DIFFUSE-BOND keyword, a default value of 
0.000156 is used.
 
DIFFUSE-CHARGE [real]     This keyword is used during 
potential function smoothing procedures to specify the 
effective diffusion coefficient to be applied to the 
smoothed form of the Coulomb's Law charge-charge potential 
function. In the absence of the DIFFUSE-CHARGE keyword, a 
default value of 3.5 is used.
 
DIFFUSE-IMPROPER [real]     This keyword is used during 
potential function smoothing procedures to specify the 
effective diffusion coefficient to be applied to the 
Gaussian form of the improper dihedral potential function. 
In the absence of the DIFFUSE-IMPROPER keyword, a default 
value of 0.0225 is used.
 
DIFFUSE-TORSION [real]     This keyword is used during 
potential function smoothing procedures to specify the 
effective diffusion coefficient to be applied to the 
smoothed form of the torsion angle potential function. In 
the absence of the DIFFUSE-TORSION keyword, a default value 
of 0.0225 is used.

DIFFUSE-VDW [real]     This keyword is used during potential 
function smoothing procedures to specify the effective 
diffusion coefficient to be applied to the smoothed Gaussian 
approximation to the Lennard-Jones van der Waals potential 
function. In the absence of the DIFFUSE-VDW keyword, a 
default value of 1.0 is used.

DIPOLE [2 integers & 2 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for a single bond dipole electrostatic parameter. The 
integer modifiers give the atom type numbers for the two 
kinds of atoms involved in the bond dipole which is to be 
defined. The real number modifiers give the value of the 
bond dipole in Debyes and the position of the dipole site 
along the bond. If the bond dipole value is positive, then 
the first of the two atom types is the positive end of the 
dipole. For a negative bond dipole value, the first atom 
type listed is negative. The position along the bond is an 
optional modifier that gives the postion of the dipole site 
as a fraction between the first atom type (position=0) and 
the second atom type (position=1). The default for the 
dipole position in the absence of a specified value is 0.5, 
placing the dipole at the midpoint of the bond.

DIPOLE3 [2 integers & 2 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for a single bond dipole electrostatic parameter 
specific to atoms in 3-membered rings. The integer modifiers 
give the atom type numbers for the two kinds of atoms 
involved in the bond dipole which is to be defined. The real 
number modifiers give the value of the bond dipole in Debyes 
and the position of the dipole site along the bond. The 
default for the dipole position in the absence of a 
specified value is 0.5, placing the dipole at the midpoint 
of the bond. If any DIPOLE3 keywords are present, either in 
the master force field parameter file or the keyfile, then 
TINKER requires that special DIPOLE3 parameters be given for 
all bond dipoles in 3-membered rings. In the absence of any 
DIPOLE3 keywords, standard DIPOLE parameters will be used 
for bonds in 3-membered rings.

DIPOLE4 [2 integers & 2 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for a single bond dipole electrostatic parameter 
specific to atoms in 4-membered rings. The integer modifiers 
give the atom type numbers for the two kinds of atoms 
involved in the bond dipole which is to be defined. The real 
number modifiers give the value of the bond dipole in Debyes 
and the position of the dipole site along the bond. The 
default for the dipole position in the absence of a 
specified value is 0.5, placing the dipole at the midpoint 
of the bond. If any DIPOLE4 keywords are present, either in 
the master force field parameter file or the keyfile, then 
TINKER requires that special DIPOLE4 parameters be given for 
all bond dipoles in 4-membered rings. In the absence of any 
DIPOLE4 keywords, standard DIPOLE parameters will be used 
for bonds in 4-membered rings.

DIPOLE5 [2 integers & 2 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for a single bond dipole electrostatic parameter 
specific to atoms in 5-membered rings. The integer modifiers 
give the atom type numbers for the two kinds of atoms 
involved in the bond dipole which is to be defined. The real 
number modifiers give the value of the bond dipole in Debyes 
and the position of the dipole site along the bond. The 
default for the dipole position in the absence of a 
specified value is 0.5, placing the dipole at the midpoint 
of the bond. If any DIPOLE5 keywords are present, either in 
the master force field parameter file or the keyfile, then 
TINKER requires that special DIPOLE5 parameters be given for 
all bond dipoles in 5-membered rings. In the absence of any 
DIPOLE5 keywords, standard DIPOLE parameters will be used 
for bonds in 5-membered rings.

DIPOLETERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of the 
dipole-dipole potential energy term between pairs of bond 
dipoles. In the absence of a modifying option, this keyword 
turns on use of the potential. The NONE option turns off use 
of this potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all 
potential energy terms except for this one.

DIVERGE [real]     This keyword is used by the SADDLE 
program to set the maximum allowed value of the ratio of the 
gradient length along the path to the total gradient norm at 
the end of a cycle of minimization perpendicular to the 
path. If the value provided by the DIVERGE keyword is 
exceeded, then another cycle of maximization along the path 
is required. A default value of 0.005 is used in the absence 
of the DIVERGE keyword.

DPL-CUTOFF [real]     Sets the cutoff distance value in 
Angstroms for bond dipole-bond dipole electrostatic 
potential energy interactions. The energy for any pair of 
bond dipole sites beyond the cutoff distance will be set to 
zero. Other keywords can be used to select a smoothing 
scheme near the cutoff distance. The default cutoff distance 
in the absence of the DPL-CUTOFF keyword is essentially 
infinite for nonperiodic systems and 10.0 for periodic 
systems.

DPL-TAPER [real]     This keyword allows modification of the 
cutoff windows for bond dipole-bond dipole electrostatic 
potential energy interactions. It is similar in form and 
action to the TAPER keyword, except that its value applies 
only to the vdw potential. The default value in the absence 
of the DPL-TAPER keyword is to begin the cutoff window at 
0.75 of the dipole cutoff distance.

ECHO [text string]     The presence of this keyword causes 
whatever text follows it on the line to be copied directly 
to the output file. This keyword is also active in parameter 
files. It has no default value; if no text follows the ECHO 
keyword, a blank line is placed in the output file.

EPSILONRULE [GEOMETRIC/ARITHMETIC/HARMONIC/HHG]     This 
keyword selects the combining rule used to derive the e 
value for van der Waals interactions. The default in the 
absence of the EPSILONRULE keyword is to use the GEOMETRIC 
mean of the individual e values of the two atoms involved in 
the van der Waals interaction.

EPSLN [real]     This keyword specifies the minimum size of 
a move in the optimization parameters that will be accepted 
during conjugate gradient optimization. If the size of the 
move for a single iteration is less than this value, an 
error condition is noted that may lead to termination of the 
optimization. The default value in the absence of the EPSLN 
keyword should be the machine precision and is set to 10-16 
in the double precision version of TINKER.

EWALD-ALPHA [real]     Sets the value of the Ewald 
coefficient which controls the width of the Gaussian 
screening charges during particle mesh Ewald summation. In 
the absence of the EWALD-ALPHA keyword, a value is chosen 
which causes interactions outside the real-space cutoff to 
be below a fixed tolerance. For most standard applications 
of PME, the program default should be used.

EWALD-CUTOFF [real]     Sets the value in Angstroms of the 
real-space distance cutoff for use during particle mesh 
Ewald summation. By default, in the absence of the EWALD-
CUTOFF keyword, a value of 9.0 is used.

EWALDTERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of 
particle mesh Ewald summation to compute the potential 
energy term between atomic partial charges under periodic 
boundary conditions. In the absence of a modifying option, 
this keyword turns on use PME when applicable. The NONE 
option turns off use of PME, and thus the charge-charge 
energy term. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy 
terms except for the PME-based charge-charge energy. Note 
that PME is used by default for partial charge 
electrostatics under periodic boundary conditions. To use 
spherical cutoff methods with periodic boundaries, it is 
necessary to turn off use of PME and enable the charge-
charge term with the CHARGETERM keyword.

EXIT-PAUSE     This keyword causes TINKER programs to pause 
and wait for a carriage return at the end of executation 
prior to returning control to the operating system. This is 
useful to keep the execution window open following 
termination on machines running Microsoft Windows or Apple 
MacOS. The default in the absence of the EXIT-PAUSE keyword, 
is to return control to the operating system immediately at 
program termination.

EXTRATERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of the 
user defined extra potential energy term. In the absence of 
a modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the 
potential. The NONE option turns off use of this potential 
energy term. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy 
terms except for this one.

FAST [real]     This keyword specifies a rapid rate of 
function decrease during conjugate gradient optimization. If 
the ratio of the objective function decrease on the current 
iteration to the amount remaining above the desired function 
value as specified by the FCTMIN keyword is greater than the 
value specified by FAST, then the next step will be taken in 
the steepest descent direction. The default value in the 
absence of the FAST keyword is 0.5.

FCTMIN [real]     This keyword sets a convergence criterion 
for successful completion of a TINKER optimization. If the 
value of the optimization objective function, typically the 
potential energy, falls below the value set by FCTMIN, then 
the optimization is deemed to have converged. The default 
value in the absence of the FCTMIN keyword is -1000000, 
effectively removing this criterion as a possible agent for 
termination.

FLETCHER-REEVES     The presence of this keyword causes the 
conjugate gradient nonlinear optimization routine employed 
by MINIMIZE, MINIROT and other programs to use the Fletcher-
Reeves update formula instead of the default Memoryless 
Quasi-Newton update formula.

FORCEFIELD [name]     This keyword provides a name for the 
force field to be used in the current calculation. Its value 
is usually set in the master force field parameter file for 
the calculation (see the PARAMETERS keyword) instead of in 
the keyfile.

FRICTION [real]     Sets the value of the frictional 
coefficient in ps-1 for use with stochastic dynamics. The 
default value used in the absence of the FRICTION keyword is 
91.0, which is generally appropriate for water.

GAMMA [real]     Sets the value of the g angle of a crystal 
unit cell, i.e., the angle between the a-axis and b-axis of 
a unit cell, or, equivalently, the angle between the X-axis 
and Z-axis of a periodic box. The default value in the 
absence of the GAMMA keyword is to set the g angle equal to 
the a angle as given by the keyword ALPHA.

GAMMAMIN [real]     Sets the convergence target value for g 
during searches for maxima along the quadratic synchronous 
transit used by the SADDLE program. The value of g is the 
square of the ratio of the gradient projection along the 
path to the total gradient. A default value of 0.00001 is 
used in the absence of the GAMMAMIN keyword.
 
GAUSSTYPE [LJ-2/LJ-4/MM2-2/MM3-2/IN-PLACE]     This keyword 
specifies the underlying vdw form that a Gaussian vdw 
approximation will attempt to fit.number of terms to be used 
in a Gaussian approximation of the Lennard-Jones van der 
Waals potential. The text modifier gives the name of the 
functional form to be used. Thus LJ-2 as a modifier will 
result in a 2-Gaussian fit to a Lennard-Jones vdw potential. 
The GAUSSTYPE keyword only takes effect when VDWTYPE is set 
to GAUSSIAN. This keyword has no default value.

GROUP [integer, integer list]     This keyword defines an 
atom group as a substructure within the full input molecular 
structure. The value of the first integer is the group 
number which must be in the range from 1 to the maximum 
number of allowed groups. The remaining intergers give the 
atom or atoms contained in this group as one or more atom 
numbers or ranges. Multiple keyword lines can be used to 
specify additional atoms in the same group. Note that an 
atom can only be in one group, the last group to which it is 
assigned is the one used.

GROUP-NEIGHBORS     This keyword causes the attached atom to 
be used in determining the charge-charge neighbor distance 
for all monovalent atoms in the molecular system. Its use 
causes all monovalent atoms to be treated the same as their 
attached atoms for purposes of including or scaling 1-2, 1-3 
and 1-4 interactions. This option works only for the simple 
"charge-charge" electrostatic potential; it does not affect 
bond dipole or atomic multipole potentials. The GROUP-
NEIGHBORS scheme is similar to that used by some common 
force fields such as ENCAD.

HBOND [2 integers & 2 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for the MM3-style directional hydrogen bonding 
parameters for a single pair of atoms. The integer modifiers 
give the pair of atom class numbers for which hydrogen 
bonding parameters are to be defined. The two real number 
modifiers give the values of the minimum energy contact 
distance in Å and the well depth at the minimum distance in 
kcal/mole.     

HESS-CUTOFF [real]     This keyword defines a lower limit 
for significant Hessian matrix elements. During computation 
of the Hessian matrix of partial second derivatives, any 
matrix elements with absolute value below HESS-CUTOFF will 
be set to zero and omitted from the sparse matrix Hessian 
storage scheme used by TINKER. For most calculations, the 
default in the absence of this keyword is zero, i.e., all 
elements will be stored. For most Truncated Newton 
optimizations the Hessian cutoff will be chosen dynamically 
by the optimizer.

HESTENES-STIEFEL     The presence of this keyword causes the 
conjugate gradient nonlinear optimization routine employed 
by MINIMIZE, MINIROT and other programs to use the Hestenes-
Stiefel update formula instead of the default Memoryless 
Quasi-Newton update formula.

HGUESS [real]     Sets an initial guess for the average 
value of the diagonal elements of the scaled inverse Hessian 
matrix. This value is used only by the optimally conditioned 
variable metric optimization routine in TINKER. A default 
value of 0.4 is used in the absence of the HGUESS keyword.

IMPROPER [4 integers & 2 reals]     This keyword provides 
the values for a single CHARMM-style improper torsional 
angle parameter.

IMPROPERTERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of 
the CHARMM-style improper torsional angle potential energy 
term. In the absence of a modifying option, this keyword 
turns on use of the potential. The NONE option turns off use 
of this potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all 
potential energy terms except for this one.

IMPTORS [4 integers & up to 3 real/real/integer triples]     
This keyword provides the values for a single AMBER-style 
improper torsional angle parameter. The first four integer 
modifiers give the atom class numbers for the atoms involved 
in the improper torsional angle to be defined. By 
convention, the third atom class of the four is the trigonal 
atom on which the improper torsion is centered. The 
torsional angle computed is literally that defined by the 
four atom classes in the order specified by the keyword. 
Each of the remaining triples of real/real/integer modifiers 
give the half-amplitude, phase offset in degrees and 
periodicity of a particular improper torsional term, 
respectively. Periodicities through 3-fold are allowed for 
improper torsional parameters.

IMPTORSTERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of the 
AMBER-style improper torsional angle potential energy term. 
In the absence of a modifying option, this keyword turns on 
use of the potential. The NONE option turns off use of this 
potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all 
potential energy terms except for this one.

INACTIVE [integer list]     Sets the list of inactive atoms 
during a TINKER computation. Individual potential energy 
terms are not computed when all atoms involved in the term 
are inactive. For Cartesian space calculations, inactive 
atoms are not allowed to move. For torsional space 
calculations, rotations are not allowed when there are 
inactive atoms on both sides of the rotated bond. Multiple 
INACTIVE lines can be present in the keyfile, and on each 
line the keyword can be followed by one or more atom numbers 
or ranges. If any INACTIVE keys are found, all atoms are set 
to active except those listed on the INACTIVE lines. The 
ACTIVE keyword overrides all INACTIVE keywords found in the 
keyfile.

INTEGRATE [VERLET/BEEMAN/STOCHASTIC]     Chooses the 
integration method for propagation of dynamics trajectories. 
The keyword is followed on the same line by the name of the 
option. Standard Newtonian MD can be run using either VERLET 
for the Velocity Verlet method, or BEEMAN for the velocity 
form of Bernie Brook's "Better Beeman" method. A Velocity 
Verlet-based stochastic dynamics trajectory is selected by 
the STOCHASTIC modifier. The default integration scheme is 
MD using the BEEMAN method.

INTMAX [integer]     Sets the maximum number of 
interpolation cycles that will be allowed during the line 
search phase of an optimization. All gradient-based TINKER 
optimization routines use a common line search routine 
involving quadratic extrapolation and cubic interpolation. 
If the value of INTMAX is reached, an error status is set 
for the line search and the search is repeated with a much 
smaller initial step size. The default value in the absence 
of this keyword is optimization routine dependent, but is 
usually in the range 5 to 10.

LAMBDA [real]     This keyword sets the value of the l path 
parameter for free energy perturbation calculations. The 
real number modifier specifies the position along the 
mutation path and must be a number in the range from 0 
(initial state) to 1 (final state). The actual atoms 
involved in the mutation are given separately in individual 
MUTATE keyword lines.

LIGHTS     This keyword turns on Method of Lights neighbor 
generation for the charge-charge potential and any of the 
van der Waals potentials. This method will yield identical 
energetic results to the standard double loop method. 
"Lights" will be faster when the volume of a sphere with 
radius equal to the nonbond cutoff distance is significantly 
less than half the volume of the total system (i.e., the 
full molecular system, the crystal unit cell or the periodic 
box).

MAXITER [integer]     Sets the maximum number of 
minimization iterations that will be allowed for any TINKER 
program that uses any of the nonlinear optimization 
routines. The default value in the absence of this keyword 
is program dependent, but is always set to a very large 
number.

MPOLETERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of the 
atomic multipole electrostatics potential energy term. In 
the absence of a modifying option, this keyword turns on use 
of the potential. The NONE option turns off use of this 
potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all 
potential energy terms except for this one.

MULTIPOLE [5 lines with: 3 integers & 1 real, 3 reals, 1 
real, 2 reals, 3 reals]     This keyword provides the values 
for a single set of atomic multipole parameters.

MUTATE [3 integers]     This keyword is used to specify 
atoms to be mutated during free energy perturbation 
calculations. The first integer modifier gives the atom 
number of an atom in the current system. The final two 
modifier values give the atom types corresponding the the 
l=0 and l=1 states of the specified atom.

NEUTRAL-GROUPS     The keyword causes the attached atom to 
be used in determining the charge-charge interaction cutoff 
distance for all monovalent atoms in the molecular system. 
Its use reduces cutoff discontinuities by avoiding splitting 
many of the largest "charge separations" found in typical 
molecules. Note that this keyword does not rigorously 
implement the usual concept of a "neutral group" as used in 
the literature with AMBER/OPLS and other force fields. This 
option works only for the simple "charge-charge" 
electrostatic potential; it does not affect bond dipole or 
atomic multipole potentials.

NEWHESS [integer]     Sets the number of algorithmic 
iterations between recomputation of the Hessian matrix. At 
present this keyword applies exclusively to optimizations 
using the Truncated Newton method. The default value in the 
absence of this keyword is 1, i.e., the Hessian is computed 
on every iteration.

NEXTITER [integer]     Sets the iteration number to be used 
for the first iteration of the current computation. At 
present this keyword applies to optimization procedures 
where its use can effect convergence criteria, timing of 
restarts, and so forth. The default in the absence of this 
keyword is to take the initial iteration as iteration 1.

NOVERSION     Turns off the use of "version numbers" 
appended to the end of filenames as the method for 
generating filenames for updated copies of an existing file. 
The presence of this keyword results in direct use of input 
file names without a search for the highest available 
version, and requires the entry of specific output file 
names in many additional cases. By default, in the absence 
of this keyword, TINKER generates and attaches version 
numbers in a manner similar to the Digital OpenVMS operating 
system. For example, subsequent new versions of the file 
molecule.xyz would be written first to the file 
molecule.xyz_2, then to molecule.xyz_3, etc.

OCTAHEDRON     Specifies that the periodic "box" is a 
truncated octahedron with maximal distance across the 
truncated octahedron as given by the A-AXIS keyword. All 
other unit cell and periodic box size-defining keywords are 
ignored if the OCTAHEDRON keyword is present.

OPBEND [2 integers & 1 real]     This keyword provides the 
values for a single Allinger MM-style out-of-plane angle 
bending potential parameter.

OPBENDTERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of the 
Allinger MM-style out-of-plane bending potential energy 
term. In the absence of a modifying option, this keyword 
turns on use of the potential. The NONE option turns off use 
of this potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all 
potential energy terms except for this one.

OPBENDUNIT [real]     Sets the scale factor needed to 
convert the energy value computed by the Allinger MM-style 
out-of-plane bending potential into units of kcal/mole. The 
correct value is force field dependent and typically 
provided in the header of the master force field parameter 
file. The default of (p/180)2 = 0.0003046 is used, if the 
OPBENDUNIT keyword is not given in the force field parameter 
file or the keyfile.

OVERWRITE     Causes TINKER programs, such as minimizations, 
that output intermediate coordinate sets to create a single 
disk file for the intermediate results which is successively 
overwritten with the new intermediate coordinates as they 
become available. This keyword is essentially the opposite 
of the SAVECYCLE keyword.

PARAMETERS [file name]     Provides the name of the force 
field parameter file to be used for the current TINKER 
calculation. The standard file name extension for parameter 
files, .prm, is an optional part of the file name modifier. 
The default in the absence of the PARAMETERS keyword is to 
look for a parameter file with the same base name as the 
molecular system and ending in the .prm extension. If a 
valid parameter file is not found, the user will asked to 
provide a file name interactively.

PERIOD [integer]     This keyword specifies the maximum 
number of conjugate gradient minimization iterations between 
restarts, i.e., zeroing the accumulated conjugate directions 
and taking a step in the steepest descent direction. The 
default is to perform a periodic restart every 200 
iterations or after a number of iterations equal to the 
number of variables being optimized, whichever is greater.

PIATOM [1 integer & 3 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for the pisystem MO potential parameters for a single 
atom class belonging to a pisystem.

PIBOND [2 integers & 2 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for the pisystem MO potential parameters for a single 
type of pisystem bond.

PISYSTEM [integer list]     This keyword sets the atoms 
within a molecule that are part of a conjugated p-system. 
The keyword is followed on the same line by a list of atom 
numbers and/or atom ranges that constitute the p-system. The 
Allinger MM force fields use this information to set up an 
MO calculation used to scale bond and torsion parameters 
involving p-system atoms.

PME-GRID [3 integers]     This keyword sets the dimensions 
of the charge grid used during particle mesh Ewald 
summation. The three modifiers give the size along the X-, 
Y- and Z-axes, respectively. If either the Y- or Z-axis 
dimensions are omitted, then they are set equal to the X-
axis dimension. The default in the absence of the PME-GRID 
keyword is to set the grid size along each axis to the 
smallest power of 2, 3 and/or 5 which is at least as large 
as 1.5 times the axis length in Angstoms. Note that the FFT 
used by PME is not restricted to, but is most efficient for, 
grid sizes which are powers of 2, 3 and/or 5.

PME-ORDER [integer]     This keyword sets the order of the 
B-spline interpolation used during particle mesh Ewald 
summation. A default value of 8 is used in the absence of 
the PME-ORDER keyword.

POLAK-RIBIERE     The presence of this keyword causes the 
conjugate gradient nonlinear optimization routine employed 
by MINIMIZE, MINIROT and other programs to use the Polak-
Ribiere update formula instead of the default Memoryless 
Quasi-Newton update formula.

POLAR-DAMP [2 reals]     Controls the strength of the 
damping function applied to induced dipoles and dipole 
polarization interaction energies. The first modifier sets 
the radius in Angstoms of a hypothetical atom with unit 
polarizability, while the second modifier sets the scale 
factor for the exponent of the  damping function. The 
default values for the radius and the scale factor are 1.662 
and 1.0, respectively. Damping is eliminated entirely by 
using this keyword to set the radius value to zero. 

POLAR-EPS [real]     This keyword sets the convergence 
criterion applied during computation of self-consistent 
induced dipoles. The calculation is deemed to have converged 
when the RMS change (in Debyes) of the induced dipoles at 
all polarizable sites is less than the value specified with 
this keyword. The default value in the absence of the 
keyword is 10-6 Debyes.

POLARIZATION [DIRECT/MUTUAL]     Selects between the use of 
direct and mutual dipole polarization for force fields that 
incorporate the polarization term. The DIRECT modifier 
avoids an iterative calculation by using only the permanent 
electric field in computation of induced dipoles. The MUTUAL 
option, which is the default in the absence of the 
POLARIZATION keyword, iterates the induced dipoles to self-
consistency.

POLARIZE [1 integer & 1 real]     This keyword provides the 
values for a single atomic dipole polarizability parameter. 
The integer modifier, if positive, gives the atom type 
number for which a polarizability parameter is to be 
defined. If the integer modifier is negative, then the 
parameter value to follow applies only to the individual 
atom whose atom number is the negative of the modifier. The 
real number modifier gives the value of the dipole 
polarizability in Å3.

POLARIZETERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of 
the atomic dipole polarization potential energy term. In the 
absence of a modifying option, this keyword turns on use of 
the potential. The NONE option turns off use of this 
potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all 
potential energy terms except for this one.

POWELL-BEALE     The presence of this keyword causes the 
conjugate gradient nonlinear optimization routine employed 
by MINIMIZE, MINIROT and other programs to use the Powell-
Beale update formula and restart method instead of the 
default Memoryless Quasi-Newton update formula.

PRINTOUT [integer]     A general parameter for iterative 
procedures such as minimizations that sets the number of 
iterations between writes of status information to the 
standard output. The default value in the absence of the 
keyword is 1, i.e., the calculation status is given every 
iteration.

RADIUSRULE [ARITHMETIC/GEOMETRIC/CUBIC-MEAN]     Sets the 
functional form of the radius combining rule for 
heteroatomic van der Waals potential energy interactions. 
The default in the absence of the RADIUSRULE keyword is to 
use the arithmetic mean combining rule to get radii for 
heteroatomic interactions.

RADIUSSIZE [RADIUS/DIAMETER]     Determines whether the atom 
size values given in van der Waals parameters read from VDW 
keyword statements are interpreted as atomic radius or 
diameter values. The default in the absence of the 
RADIUSSIZE keyword is to assume that vdw size parameters are 
given as radius values.

RADIUSTYPE [R-MIN/SIGMA]     Determines whether atom size 
values given in van der Waals parameters read from VDW 
keyword statements are interpreted as potential minimum 
(Rmin) or LJ-style sigma (s) values. The default in the 
absence of the RADIUSTYPE keyword is to assume that vdw size 
parameters are given as Rmin values.

RANDOMSEED [integer]     Followed by an integer value, this 
keyword sets the initial "seed" value for the random number 
generator used by TINKER. Setting RANDOMSEED to the same 
value as an earlier run will allow exact reproduction of the 
earlier calculation. (Note that this will not hold across 
different machine types.) RANDOMSEED should be set to a 
positive integer less than about 2 billion. In the absence 
of the RANDOMSEED keyword the seed is chosen "randomly" 
based upon the number of seconds that have elapsed in the 
current decade.

RATTLE [BONDS/ANGLES/DIATOMIC/TRIATOMIC/WATER]     Invokes 
the rattle algorithm, a velocity version of shake, on 
portions of a molecular system during a molecular dynamic 
calculation. The RATTLE keyword can be followed by any of 
the modifiers shown, in which case all occurrences of the 
modifier species are constrained at "ideal" values taken 
from the bond and angle parameters of the force field in 
use. In the absence of any modifier, RATTLE constrains all 
bonds to hydrogen atoms at ideal bond lengths.
  
RATTLE-BOND [2 integers]     This keyword allows the use of 
rattle (see above) on a the bond between the two atoms whose 
numbers are specified on the keyword line. If the two atoms 
are involved in a covalent bond, then their distance is 
constrained to the "ideal" bond length from the force field. 
For nonbonded atoms, the rattle constraint fixes their 
distance at the distance in the input coordinate file.
  
REACTIONFIELD [2 reals & 1 integer]     This keyword 
provides parameters needed for the reaction field potential 
energy calculation. The two real modifiers give the radius 
of the dielectric cavity and the ratio of the bulk 
dielectric outside the cavity to that inside the cavity. The 
integer modifier gives the number of terms in the reaction 
field summation to be used. In the absence of the 
REACTIONFIELD keyword, the default values are a cavity of 
radius 1000000 Å, a dielectric ratio of 80 and use of only 
the first term of the reaction field summation.

REDUCE [real]     Specifies the fraction between zero and 
one by which the path between starting and final 
conformational state will be shortened at each major cycle 
of the transition state location algorithm implemented by 
the SADDLE program. This causes the path endpoints to move 
up and out of the terminal structures toward the transition 
state region. In favorable cases, a nonzero value of the 
REDUCE modifier can speed convergence to the transition 
state. The default value in the absence of the REDUCE 
keyword is zero.

RESTRAIN-DIHEDRAL [4 integers & 3 reals]     This keyword 
implements a flat-welled harmonic potential that can be used 
to restrain the dihedral angle between four atoms to lie 
within a specified angle range. The initial integer 
modifiers contains the atom numbers of the four atoms whose 
dihedral angle, computed in the atom order listed, is to be 
restrained. The first two real number modifiers give the 
lower and upper bounds in degrees on the allowed dihedral 
angle values. The angle values given can wrap around across 
-180 and +180 degrees. Outside the allowed angle range, a 
harmonic potential with force constant in kcal/degree2 given 
by the final real modifier is applied. If the force constant 
is omitted, a default value of 1.0 is used. If all the real 
modifiers are omitted, then the atoms are restrained to a 
dihedral angle of zero with the default force constant.

RESTRAIN-DISTANCE [2 integers & 3 reals]     This keyword 
implements a flat-welled harmonic potential that can be used 
to restrain two atoms to lie within a specified distance 
range. The initial integer modifiers contains the atom 
numbers of the two atoms to be restrained. If the 
interatomic distance lies between the lower and upper 
bounds, the restraint potential is zero. Outside the bounds, 
a harmonic potential with force constant in kcal/Å2 given by 
the final real modifier is applied. If the force constant is 
omitted, a default value of 100.0 is used. If all the real 
modifiers are omitted, then the atoms are restrained to an 
interatomic distance of zero with the default force 
constant.

RESTRAIN-POSITION [1 integer & 4 reals]     This keyword 
provides the ability to restrain an individual atom to a 
specified coordinate position. The initial integer modifier 
contains the atom number of the atom to be restrained. The 
first three real number modifiers give the X-, Y- and Z-
coordinates to which the atom is tethered. The final real 
modifier sets the force constant in kcal/Å2 for the harmonic 
restraint potential. If the force constant is omitted, a 
default value of 100.0 is used. If all the real modifiers 
are omitted, then the atom is restrained to the origin with 
the default force constant.

RESTRAINTERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of 
the restraint potential energy terms. In the absence of a 
modifying option, this keyword turns on use of these 
potentials. The NONE option turns off use of these potential 
energy terms. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy 
terms except for these terms.
 
RXNFIELDTERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of 
the reaction field continuum solvation potential energy 
term. In the absence of a modifying option, this keyword 
turns on use of the potential. The NONE option turns off use 
of this potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all 
potential energy terms except for this one.

SADDLEPOINT     The presence of this keyword allows Newton-
style second derivative-based optimization routine used by 
NEWTON, NEWTROT and other programs to converge to 
saddlepoints as well as minima on the potential surface. By 
default, in the absence of the SADDLEPOINT keyword, checks 
are applied that prevent convergence to stationary points 
having directions of negative curvature.

SAVECYCLE     Causes TINKER programs, such as minimizations, 
that output intermediate coordinate sets to save each 
successive set to the next consecutively numbered cycle 
file. This keyword is essentially the opposite of the 
OVERWRITE keyword.

SELECT-GROUP [2 integers, real]     This keyword gives the 
weight in the final potential energy of a specified set of 
intra- or intergroup interactions. The integer modifiers 
give the group numbers of the groups involved. If the two 
numbers are the same, then an intragroup set of interactions 
is specified. The real modifier gives the weight by which 
all energetic interactions in this set will be multiplied 
before incorporation into the final potential energy. If 
omitted as a keyword modifier, the weight will be set to 1.0 
by default. If any SELECT-GROUP keywords are present, then 
any set of interactions not specified in a SELECT-GROUP 
keyword is given a zero weight. The default when no SELECT-
GROUP keywords are specified is to use all intergroup 
interactions with a weight of 1.0 and to set all intragroup 
interactions to zero.

SLOW [real]     This keyword specifies the limit of an 
unacceptably slow rate of function decrease during conjugate 
gradient optimization. If the ratio of the objective 
function decrease on the current iteration to the amount 
remaining above the desired function value as specified by 
the FCTMIN keyword is less than the value specified by SLOW, 
then an error condition is noted that may lead to 
termination. The default value in the absence of the SLOW 
keyword is zero, effectively removing this progress check.

SOLVATE [ASP/SASA/GBSA integer]     Use of this keyword 
during energy calculations with any of the standard force 
fields turns on a macroscopic hydration free energy term. 
The modifier selects between the Eisenberg-McLachlan ASP 
method (using the Wesson-Eisenberg vacuum-to-water 
parameters), the Ooi-Scheraga SASA method, or the Macromodel 
GB/SA method. In the absence of a modifier, the ASP method 
is used. At present, GB/SA is only valid for force fields 
that use simple partial charge electrostatics. The GBSA 
modifier takes an additional integer value that is the 
maximum number of atoms for which the original Macromodel 
algorithm is used to compute Born radii. If a system has 
more than this number of atoms, the approximate GB/SA method 
of Hawkins, Cramer and Truhlar is used. The default value 
for the maximum number of atoms for the Macromodel GB/SA 
Born radii is 300.

SOLVATETERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of the 
macroscopic solvation potential energy term. In the absence 
of a modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the 
potential. The NONE option turns off use of this potential 
energy term. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy 
terms except for this one.

SPACEGROUP [name]     This keyword selects the space group 
to be used in manipulation of crystal unit cells and 
asymmetric units. The name option must be chosen from one of 
the following currently implemented space groups: P1, P1(-), 
P21, Cc, P21/a, P21/n, P21/c, C2/c, P212121, Pna21, Pn21a, 
Cmc21, Pccn, Pbcn, Pbca, P41, I41/a, P4(-)21c, P4(-)m2, R3c, 
P6(3)/mcm, Fm3(-)m, Im3(-)m.

SPHERE [4 reals, or 1 integer & 1 real]     This keyword 
provides an alternative to the ACTIVE and INACTIVE keywords 
for specification of subsets of active atoms. If four real 
number modifiers are provided, the first three are taken as 
X-, Y- and Z-coordinates and the fourth is the radius of a 
sphere centered at these coordinates. In this case, all 
atoms within the sphere at the start of the calculation are 
active throughout the calculation, while all other atoms are 
inactive. Similarly if one integer and real number are 
given, an "active" sphere with radius set by the real is 
centered on the system atom with atom number given by the 
integer modifier. Multiple SPHERE keyword lines can be 
present in a single keyfile, and the list of active atoms 
specified by the spheres is cumulative.

STEEPEST-DESCENT     The presence of this keyword causes the 
conjugate gradient nonlinear optimization routine employed 
by MINIMIZE, MINIROT and other programs to use the simple 
steepest descent update formula instead of the default 
Memoryless Quasi-Newton update formula.

STEPMAX [real]     This keyword and its modifying value set 
the maximum size of an individual step during the line 
search phase of conjugate gradient or truncated Newon 
optimizations. The step size is computed as the norm of the 
vector of changes in parameters being optimized. The default 
value depends on the particular TINKER program, but is 
usually in the range from 1.0 to 5.0 when not specified via 
the STEPMAX keyword.

STEPMIN [real]     This keyword and its modifying value set 
the minimum size of an individual step during the line 
search phase of conjugate gradient or truncated Newon 
optimizations. The step size is computed as the norm of the 
vector of changes in parameters being optimized. The default 
value is usually set to about 10-16 when not specified via 
the STEPMIN keyword.

STRBND [1 integer & 3 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for a single stretch-bend cross term potential 
parameter. The integer modifier gives the atom class number 
for the central atom of the bond angle involved in stretch-
bend interactions. The real number modifiers give the force 
constant values to be used when the central atom of the 
angle is attached to 0, 1 or 2 additional hydrogen atoms, 
respectively. The default units for the stretch-bend force 
constant are kcal/mole/Å-degree, but this can be controlled 
via the STRBNDUNIT keyword.

STRBNDTERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of the 
bond stretching-angle bending cross term potential energy. 
In the absence of a modifying option, this keyword turns on 
use of the potential. The NONE option turns off use of this 
potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all 
potential energy terms except for this one.

STRBNDUNIT [real]     Sets the scale factor needed to 
convert the energy value computed by the bond stretching-
angle bending cross term potential into units of kcal/mole. 
The correct value is force field dependent and typically 
provided in the header of the master force field parameter 
file. The default value of 1.0 is used, if the STRBNDUNIT 
keyword is not given in the force field parameter file or 
the keyfile.

STRTORS [2 integers & 1 real]     This keyword provides the 
values for a single stretch-torsion cross term potential 
parameter. The two integer modifiers give the atom class 
numbers for the atoms involved in the central bond of the 
torsional angles to be parameterized. The real modifier 
gives the value of the stretch-torsion force constant for 
all torsional angles with the defined central bond atom 
classes. The default units for the stretch-torsion force 
constant can be controlled via the STRTORUNIT keyword.

STRTORTERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of the 
bond stretching-torsional angle cross term potential energy. 
In the absence of a modifying option, this keyword turns on 
use of the potential. The NONE option turns off use of this 
potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all 
potential energy terms except for this one.

STRTORUNIT [real]     Sets the scale factor needed to 
convert the energy value computed by the bond stretching-
torsional angle cross term potential into units of 
kcal/mole. The correct value is force field dependent and 
typically provided in the header of the master force field 
parameter file. The default value of 1.0 is used, if the 
STRTORUNIT keyword is not given in the force field parameter 
file or the keyfile.

TAPER [real]     This keyword allows modification of the 
cutoff windows for nonbonded potential energy interactions. 
The nonbonded terms are smoothly reduced from their standard 
value at the beginning of the cutoff window to zero at the 
far end of the window. The far end of the window is 
specified via the CUTOFF keyword or its potential function 
specific variants. The modifier value supplied with the 
TAPER keyword sets the beginning of the cutoff window. The 
modifier can be given either as an absolute distance value 
in Angstroms, or as a fraction between zero and one of the 
CUTOFF distance. The default value in the absence of the 
TAPER keyword ranges from 0.65 to 0.9 of the CUTOFF distance 
depending on the type of potential function. The windows are 
implemented via polynomial-based switching functions, in 
some cases combined with energy shifting.

TAU-PRESSURE [real]     Sets the coupling time in 
picoseconds for the Groningen-style pressure bath coupling 
used to control the system pressure during molecular 
dynamics calculations. A default value of 2.0 is used for 
TAU-PRESSURE in the absence of the keyword.

TAU-TEMPERATURE [real]     Sets the coupling time in 
picoseconds for the Groningen-style temperature bath 
coupling used to control the system temperature during 
molecular dynamics calculations. A default value of 0.1 is 
used for TAU-TEMPERATURE in the absence of the keyword.

TORSION [4 integers & up to 6 real/real/integer triples]     
This keyword provides the values for a single torsional 
angle parameter. The first four integer modifiers give the 
atom class numbers for the atoms involved in the torsional 
angle to be defined. Each of the remaining triples of 
real/real/integer modifiers give the half-amplitude, phase 
offset in degrees and periodicity of a particular torsional 
function term, respectively. Periodicities through 6-fold 
are allowed for torsional parameters.

TORSION4 [4 integers & up to 6 real/real/integer triples]     
This keyword provides the values for a single torsional 
angle parameter specific to atoms in 4-membered rings. The 
first four integer modifiers give the atom class numbers for 
the atoms involved in the torsional angle to be defined. The 
remaining triples of real number and integer modifiers 
operate as described above for the TORSION keyword.

TORSION5 [4 integers & up to 6 real/real/integer triples]     
This keyword provides the values for a single torsional 
angle parameter specific to atoms in 5-membered rings. The 
first four integer modifiers give the atom class numbers for 
the atoms involved in the torsional angle to be defined. The 
remaining triples of real number and integer modifiers 
operate as described above for the TORSION keyword.

TORSIONTERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of the 
torsional angle potential energy term. In the absence of a 
modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the 
potential. The NONE option turns off use of this potential 
energy term. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy 
terms except for this one.

TORSIONUNIT [real]     Sets the scale factor needed to 
convert the energy value computed by the torsional angle 
potential into units of kcal/mole. The correct value is 
force field dependent and typically provided in the header 
of the master force field parameter file. The default value 
of 1.0 is used, if the TORSIONUNIT keyword is not given in 
the force field parameter file or the keyfile.

TORTORTERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of the 
torsion-torsion potential energy term. In the absence of a 
modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the 
potential. The NONE option turns off use of this potential 
energy term. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy 
terms except for this one. This energy term is not 
implemented in the current version of TINKER.

TRIAL-DISTANCE [CLASSIC/RANDOM/TRICOR/HAVEL integer/PAIRWISE 
integer]     Sets the method for selection of a trial 
distance matrix during distance geometry computations. The 
keyword takes a modifier that selects the method to be used. 
The HAVEL and PAIRWISE modifiers also require an additional 
integer value that specifies the number of atoms used in 
metrization and the percentage of metrization, respectively. 
The default in the absence of this keyword is to use the 
PAIRWISE method with 100 percent metrization. Further 
information on the various methods is given with the 
description of the TINKER distance geometry program.

TRIAL-DISTRIBUTION [real]     Sets the initial value for the 
mean of the Gaussian distribution used to select trial 
distances between the lower and upper bounds during distance 
geometry computations. The value given must be between 0 and 
1 which represent the lower and upper bounds respectively. 
This keyword is rarely needed since TINKER will usually be 
able to choose a reasonable value by default.

TRUNCATE     Causes all distance-based nonbond energy 
cutoffs to be sharply truncated to an energy of zero at 
distances greater than the value set by the cutoff 
keyword(s) without use of any shifting, switching or 
smoothing schemes. At all distances within the cutoff 
sphere, the full interaction energy is computed.

UREYBRAD [3 integers & 2 reals]     This keyword provides 
the values for a single Urey-Bradley cross term potential 
parameter. The integer modifiers give the atom class numbers 
for the three kinds of atoms involved in the angle for which 
a Urey-Bradley term is to be defined. The real number 
modifiers give the force constant value for the term and the 
target value for the 1-3 distance in Å. The default units 
for the force constant are kcal/mole/Å2, but this can be 
controlled via the UREYUNIT keyword.

UREYTERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of the 
Urey-Bradley potential energy term. In the absence of a 
modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the 
potential. The NONE option turns off use of this potential 
energy term. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy 
terms except for this one.

UREYUNIT [real]     Sets the scale factor needed to convert 
the energy value computed by the Urey-Bradley potential into 
units of kcal/mole. The correct value is force field 
dependent and typically provided in the header of the master 
force field parameter file. The default value of 1.0 is 
used, if the UREYUNIT keyword is not given in the force 
field parameter file or the keyfile.

VDW [1 integer & 3 reals]     This keyword provides values 
for a single van der Waals parameter. The integer modifier, 
if positive, gives the atom class number for which vdw 
parameters are to be defined. Note that vdw parameters are 
given for atom classes, not atom types. The three real 
number modifiers give the values of the atom size in Å, 
homoatomic well depth in kcal/mole, and an optional 
reduction factor for univalent atoms.
 
VDW-12-USE [NONE]     This keyword determines whether the 
van der Waals potential energy will include interactions 
between 1-2 connected atoms, i.e., directly bonded atoms. In 
the absence of a modifying option, this keyword turns on 1-2 
interactions reduced by a multiplicative factor supplied via 
the VDW-SCALE keyword. The NONE option turns off use of 1-2 
interactions. The default in the absence of the VDW-12-USE 
keyword is to omit these interactions from the energy 
evaluation.
 
VDW-13-USE [NONE]     This keyword determines whether the 
van der Waals potential energy will include interactions 
between 1-3 connected atoms, i.e., atoms separated by 2 
covalent bonds. In the absence of a modifying option, this 
keyword turns on 1-3 interactions reduced by a 
multiplicative factor supplied via the VDW-SCALE keyword. 
The NONE option turns off use of 1-3 interactions. The 
default in the absence of the VDW-13-USE keyword is to omit 
these interactions from the energy evaluation.
 
VDW-14-USE [NONE]     This keyword determines whether the 
van der Waals potential energy will include interactions 
between 1-4 connected atoms, i.e., atoms separated by 3 
covalent bonds. In the absence of a modifying option, this 
keyword turns on 1-4 interactions reduced by a 
multiplicative factor supplied via the VDW-SCALE keyword. 
The NONE option turns off use of 1-4 interactions. The 
default in the absence of the VDW-14-USE keyword is to 
include these interactions in the energy evaluation.

VDW-CUTOFF [real]     Sets the cutoff distance value in 
Angstroms for van der Waals potential energy interactions. 
The energy for any pair of van der Waals sites beyond the 
cutoff distance will be set to zero. Other keywords can be 
used to select a smoothing scheme near the cutoff distance. 
The default cutoff distance in the absence of the VDW-CUTOFF 
keyword is essentially infinite for nonperiodic systems and 
10.0 for periodic systems.

VDW-SCALE [real]     This keyword provides a scale factor by 
which van der Waals potential energy interactions are 
reduced between neighboring atoms. The value associated with 
the VDW-SCALE keyword may be applied to 1-2, 1-3 and/or 1-4 
connected atom pairs as specified via the VDW-12-USE, VDW-
13-USE and VDW-14-USE keywords. The default value of 1.0 is 
used, if the VDW-SCALE keyword is not given in either the 
parameter file or the keyfile.

VDW-TAPER [real]     This keyword allows modification of the 
cutoff windows for van der Waals potential energy 
interactions. It is similar in form and action to the TAPER 
keyword, except that its value applies only to the vdw 
potential. The default value in the absence of the VDW-TAPER 
keyword is to begin the cutoff window at 0.9 of the vdw 
cutoff distance.

VDW14 [1 integer & 2 reals]     This keyword provides values 
for a single van der Waals parameter for use in 1-4 
nonbonded interactions. The integer modifier, if positive, 
gives the atom class number for which vdw parameters are to 
be defined. Note that vdw parameters are given for atom 
classes, not atom types. The two real number modifiers give 
the values of the atom size in Å and the homoatomic well 
depth in kcal/mole. Reduction factors, if used, are carried 
over from the VDW keyword for the same atom class.

VDWPR [2 integers & 2 reals]     This keyword provides the 
values for the vdw parameters for a single special 
heteroatomic pair of atoms. The integer modifiers give the 
pair of atom class numbers for which special vdw parameters 
are to be defined. The two real number modifiers give the 
values of the minimum energy contact distance in Å and the 
well depth at the minimum distance in kcal/mole.

VDWTERM [NONE/ONLY]     This keyword controls use of the van 
der Waals repulsion-dispersion potential energy term. In the 
absence of a modifying option, this keyword turns on use of 
the potential. The NONE option turns off use of this 
potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all 
potential energy terms except for this one.

VDWTYPE [LENNARD-JONES/BUCKINGHAM/BUFFERED-14-7/MM3-HBOND 
/GAUSSIAN]     Sets the functional form for the van der 
Waals potential energy term. The text modifier gives the 
name of the functional form to be used. The GAUSSIAN 
modifier value implements a two or four Gaussian fit to the 
corresponding Lennard-Jones function for use with potential 
energy smoothing schemes. The default in the absence of the 
VDWTYPE keyword is to use the standard two parameter 
Lennard-Jones function.

VERBOSE     Turns on printing of secondary and informational 
output during a variety of TINKER computations; a subset of 
the more extensive output provided by the DEBUG keyword.

WALL [real]     Sets the radius of a spherical boundary used 
to maintain "droplet" boundary conditions. The real modifier 
specifies the desired approximate radius of the droplet. In 
practice, an artificial van der Waals wall is constructed at 
a fixed buffer distance of 2.5 Å outside the specified 
radius. The effect is that atoms which attempt to move 
outside the region defined by the droplet radius will be 
forced toward the center.

WRITEOUT [integer]     A general parameter for iterative 
procedures such as minimizations that sets the number of 
iterations between writes of intermediate results (such as 
the current coordinates) to disk file(s). The default value 
in the absence of the keyword is 1, i.e., the intermediate 
results are written to file on every iteration. Whether 
successive results are saved to new files or replace 
previously written intermediate results is controlled by the 
OVERWRITE and SAVECYCLE keywords.
 8.     Notes on Special Features & Methods

     This section contains several short notes with further 
information about TINKER methodology, algorithms and special 
features. The discussion is not intended to be exhaustive, 
but rather to explain features and capabilities so that 
users can make more complete use of the package.

FILE VERSION NUMBERS

     All of the input and output file types routinely used 
by the TINKER package are capable of existing as multiple 
versions of a base file name. For example, if the program 
XYZINT is run on the input file molecule.xyz, the output 
internal coordinates file will be written to molecule.int. 
If a file named molecule.int is already present prior to 
running XYZINT, then the output will be written instead to 
the next available version, in this case to molecule.int_2. 
In fact the output is generally written to the lowest 
available, previously unused version number (molecule.int_3, 
molecule.int_4, etc., as high as needed). Input file names 
are handled similarly. If simply molecule or molecule.xyz is 
entered as the input file name upon running XYZINT, then the 
highest version of molecule.xyz will be used as the actual 
input file. If an explicit version number is entered as part 
of the input file name, then the specified version will be 
used as the input file.

     The version number scheme will be recognized by many 
older users as a holdover from the VMS origins of the first 
version of the TINKER software. It has been maintained to 
make it easier to chain together multiple calculations that 
may create several new versions of a given file, and to make 
it more difficult to accidently overwrite a needed result. 
The version scheme applies to most uses of many common 
TINKER file types such as .xyz, .int, .key, .arc. It is not 
used when an overwritten file "update" is obviously the 
correct action, for example, the .dyn molecular dynamics 
restart files. For those users who prefer a more "Unix-like" 
operation, and do not desire use of file versions, this 
feature can be turned off by adding the NOVERSION keyword to 
the applicable TINKER keyfile.

     The version scheme as implemented in TINKER does have 
two known quirks. First, it becomes impossible to directly 
use the original "unversioned" copy of a file if higher 
version numbers are present. For example, if the files 
molecule.xyz and molecule.xyz_2 both exist, then 
molecule.xyz cannot be accessed as input by XYZINT. If 
molecule.xyz is entered in response to the input file name 
question, molecule.xyz_2 (or the highest present version 
number) will be used as input. The only workaround is to 
copy or rename molecule.xyz to something else, say 
molecule.new, and use that name for the input file. 
Secondly, missing version numbers always end the search for 
the highest available version number; i.e., version numbers 
are assumed to be consecutive and without gaps. For example, 
if molecule.xyz, molecule.xyz_2 and molecule.xyz_4 are 
present, but not molecule.xyz_3, then molecule.xyz_2 will be 
used as input to XYZINT if molecule is given as the input 
file name. Similarly, output files will fill in gaps in an 
already existing set of file versions.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

     Many operating systems or compiler supplied-libraries 
make available something like the standard Unix iargc and 
getarg routines for capturing command line arguments. On 
these machines most of the TINKER programs support a 
selection of command line arguments and options. The name of 
the keyfile to be used for a calculation is read from the 
argument following a -k (equivalent to either -key or -
keyfile, case insensitive) command line argument. Note that 
the -k options can appear anywhere on the command line 
following the executable name. All other command line 
arguments, excepting the name of the executable program 
itself, are treated as input arguments. These input 
arguments are read from left to right and interpreted in 
order as the answers to questions that would be asked by an 
interactive invocation of the same TINKER program. For 
example, the following command line:

              newton molecule -k test a a 0.01

will invoke the NEWTON program on the structure file 
molecule.xyz using the keyfile test.key, automatic mode [a] 
for both the method and preconditioning, and 0.01 for the 
RMS gradient per atom termination criterion in kcal/mole/Å. 
Provided that the force field parameter set, etc. is 
provided in test.key, the above compuation will procede 
directly from the command line invocation without further 
interactive input.

USE ON WINDOWS 9X/NT SYSTEMS

     TINKER executables for Microsoft PC systems should be 
run from the "DOS box" available via the MS-DOS Prompt 
program. The TINKER executable directory should be added to 
your path via the autoexec.bat file or similar. These DOS 
terminal windows are only able to scroll a small number of 
lines (!), so TINKER programs which generate large amounts 
of screen output should be run such that output will be 
redirected to a file. This can be accomplished by running 
the TINKER program in batch mode or by using the Unix-like 
output redirection build into DOS. For example, the command:

            dynamic < molecule.inp > molecule.log

will run the TINKER dynamic program taking input from the 
file molecule.inp and sending output to molecule.log. Also 
note that command line options as described above are 
available with the distributed TINKER executables.

     If the distributed TINKER executables are directly from 
Windows by double clicking on the program icon, then the 
program will run in its own window. However, upon completion 
of the program the window will close and screen output will 
be lost. Any output files written by the program will, of 
course, still be available. The Windows behavior can be 
changed by adding the EXIT-PAUSE keyword to the keyfile.

USE ON MACINTOSH SYSTEMS

     The TINKER executables can be run under MacOS by double 
clicking on a program icon. The program will run in its own 
window to which all ``screen'' output will be directed. Upon 
program termination the window will remain active pending a 
final return entered by the user which will close the 
window. Prior to the final return, the contents of the 
screen window can be saved to a file via the clipboard for 
permanent storage. Note that Macintosh uses ":" instead of 
"/" or "\" as the directory separator, so keyfiles 
transfered from other machines will need to be altered 
accordingly.

ATOM TYPES VS. ATOM CLASSES

     Manipulation of atom "types" and the proliferation of 
parameters as atoms are further subdivided into new types is 
the bane of force field calculation. For example, if each 
topologically distinct atom arising from the 20 natural 
amino acids is given a different atom type, then about 300 
separate type are required (this ignores the "different" N- 
and C-terminal residues, diastereotopic hydrogens, etc.). 
However, these 300 types lead to literally thousands of 
different force field parameters. In fact, there are 
thousands of distinct torsional parameters alone. It is 
impossible at present to fully optimize each of these 
parameters; and even if we could, a great many of the 
parameters would be nearly identical. Two somewhat 
complimentary solutions are available to handle the 
proliferation of parameters. The first is to specify the 
molecular fragments to which a given parameter can be 
applied in terms of a chemical structure language, SMILES 
strings for example. Some commercial systems, such as the 
TRIPOS Sybyl software, make use of such a scheme to parse 
structures and assign force field parameters.

     A second general approach is to use hierarchical 
cascades of parameter groups. TINKER uses a simple version 
of this scheme. Each TINKER force field atom has both an 
atom type number and an atom class number. The types are 
subsets of the atom classes, i.e., several different atom 
types can belong to the same atom class. Force field 
parameters that are somewhat less sensitive to local 
environment, such as local geometry terms, are then provided 
and assigned based on atom class. Other energy parameters, 
such as electrostatic parameters, that are very environment 
dependent are assigned over the atom types. This greatly 
reduces the number of independent multiple-atom parameters 
like the four-atom torsional parameters.

CALCULATIONS ON PARTIAL STRUCTURES

     Two methods are available for performing energetic 
calculations on portions or substructures within a full 
molecular system. TINKER allows division of the entire 
system into active and inactive parts which can be defined 
via keywords. In subsequent calculations, such as 
minimization or dynamics, only the active portions of the 
system are allowed to move. The force field engine responds 
to the active/inactive division by computing all energetic 
interactions involving at least one active atom; i.e., any 
interaction whose energy can change with the motion of one 
or more active atoms is computed.

     The second method for partial structure computation 
involves dividing the original system into a set of atom 
groups. As before, the groups can be specified via 
appropriate keywords. The current TINKER implementation 
allows specification of up to a maximum number of groups as 
given in the sizes.i dimensioning file. The groups must be 
disjoint in that no atom can belong to more than one group. 
Further keywords allow the user to specify which intra- and 
intergroup sets of energetic interactions will contribute to 
the total force field ``energy''. Weights for each set of 
interactions in the total energy can also be input. A 
specific energetic interaction is assigned to a particular 
intra- or intergroup set if all the atoms involved in the 
interaction belong to the group (intra-) or pair of groups 
(inter-). Interactions involving atoms from more than two 
groups are not computed.

     Note that the groups method and active/inactive method 
use different assignment procedures for individual 
interactions. The active/inactive scheme is intended for 
situations where only a portion of a system is allowed to 
move, but the total energy needs to reflect the presence of 
the remaining inactive portion of the structure. The groups 
method is intended for use in rigid body motion and is 
needed for certain kinds of free energy perturbation 
calculations.

METAL COMPLEXES AND HYPERVALENT SPECIES

     The distribution version of TINKER comes dimensioned 
for a maximum atomic coordination number of four as needed 
for standard organic compounds. In order to use TINKER for 
calculations on species containing higher coordination 
numbers, simply change the value of the parameter maxval in 
the master dimensioning file sizes.i and rebuilt the 
package. Note that this parameter value should not be set 
larger than necessary since large values can slow the 
execution of portions of some TINKER programs.

     Many molecular mechanics approaches to inorganic and 
metal structures use an angle bending term which is softer 
than the usual harmonic bending potential. TINKER implements 
a Fourier bending term similar to that used by the Landis 
group's SHAPES force field. The parameters for specific 
Fourier angle terms are supplied via the ANGLEF parameter 
and keyword format. Note that a Fourier term will only be 
used for a particular angle if a corresponding harmonic 
angle term is not present in the parameter file.

NEIGHBOR METHODS FOR NONBONDED TERMS

     In addition to standard double loop methods, the Method 
of Lights is available to speed neighbor searching. This 
method based on taking intersections of sorted atom lists 
can be much faster for problems where the cutoff distance is 
significantly smaller than half the maximal cell dimension. 
The current version of TINKER does not implement the 
``neighbor list'' schemes common to many other simulation 
packages.

PERIODIC BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

     Both spherical cutoff images or replicates of a cell 
are supported by all TINKER programs that implement periodic 
boundary conditions. Whenever the cutoff distance is too 
large for the minimum image to be the only relevant neighbor 
(i.e., half the minimum box dimension for orthogonal cells), 
TINKER will automatically switch from the image formalism to 
use of replicated cells.

     This version of TINKER contains an implementation of 
the particle mesh Ewald (PME) summation for partial charge 
electrostatics. PME is selected by default when force fields 
that use atomic partial charge models are coupled with 
periodic boundard conditions.

DISTANCE CUTOFFS FOR ENERGY FUNCTIONS

     Polynomial energy switching over a window is used for 
terms whose energy is small near the cutoff distance. For 
monopole electrostatic interactions, which are quite large 
in typical cutoff ranges, a two polynomial multiplicative-
additive shifted energy switch unique to TINKER is applied. 
The TINKER method is similar in spirit to the force 
switching methods of Steinbach and Brooks, J. Comput. Chem., 
15, 667-683 (1994). While the particle mesh Ewald method is 
preferred when periodic boundary conditions are present, 
TINKER's shifted energy switch with reasonable switching 
windows is quite satisfactory for most routine modeling 
problems. The shifted energy switch minimizes the 
perturbation of the energy and the gradient at the cutoff to 
acceptable levels. Problems should arise only if the 
property you wish to monitor is known to require explicit 
inclusion of long range components (i.e., calculation of the 
dielectric constant, etc.).

PARTICLE MESH EWALD SUMMATION

     TINKER contains a version of the particle mesh Ewald 
summation technique for inclusion of long range 
electrostatics. The accuracy and speed of the PME 
calculation is dependent on several interrelated parameters 
which control the Ewald coefficient, B-spline order, real-
space cutoff distance and charge grid dimensions. By default 
TINKER will select a set of parameters which provide a 
reasonable compromise between accuracy and speed for most 
uses. Complete control over all the PME control parameters 
is available via the TINKER keyfile mechanism.

DISTANCE GEOMETRY METRIZATION

     A much improved and very fast random pairwise 
metrization scheme is available which allows good sampling 
during trial distance matrix generation without the usual 
structural anomalies and CPU constraints of other 
metrization procedures. An outline of the methodology and 
its application to NMR NOE-based structure refinement is 
described in the paper by Hodsdon, et al. in J. Mol. Biol., 
264, 585-602 (1996). We have obtained good results with 
something like the keyword phrase trial-distribution 
pairwise 5, which performs 5% partial random pairwise 
metrization. For structures over several hundred atoms, a 
value less than 5 for the percentage of metrization should 
be fine.

POLARIZABLE MULTIPOLE ELECTROSTATICS

     Atomic multipole electrostatics through the quadrupole 
moment is supported by the current version of TINKER, as is 
either mutual or direct dipole polarization. All 
calculations are implemented via the Applequist-Dykstra 
Cartesian polytensor method and analytical energy and 
Cartesian gradient code is provided.

POTENTIAL ENERGY SMOOTHING

     Versions of our Potential Smoothing and Search (PSS) 
methodology have been implemented within TINKER. This 
methods belong to the same general family as Scheraga's 
Diffusion Equation Method, Straub's Gaussian Density 
Annealing and Shalloway's Packet Annealing, but our 
algorithms reflect our own ongoing research in this area. In 
many ways the TINKER potential smoothing methods are the 
deterministic analog of stochastic simulated annealing. The 
PSS algorithms are very powerful, but are relatively new and 
are still undergoing modification, testing and calibration 
in the Ponder group. This version of TINKER also includes a 
basin-hopping conformational scanning algorithm in the 
program SCAN which is particularly effective on smoothed 
potential surfaces.
 9.     Descriptions of TINKER Routines

     The distribution version of the TINKER package contains 
over 500 separate programs, subroutines and functions. This 
section contains a brief description of the purpose of most

set of internal coordinates

CONNOLLY Subroutine

 12.    Examples using the TINKER Package

     This section contains some comments on the five sample 
calculations found in the EXAMPLE subdirectory of the TINKER 
distribution. These examples exercise many of the current 
TINKER programs and provide a flavor of the capabilities of 
the present package.

ANION Example

Computes an estimation of the free energy of hydration of 
Cl- anion vs. Br- anion via a 1 picosecond simulation on a 
"hybrid" anion in a box of water, followed by free energy 
perturbation

ARGON Example

Performs a minimization followed by 6 picoseconds of a 
molecular dynamics run on a periodic box containing 150 
argon atoms

CLUSTER Example

Performs a set of 10 Gaussian density annealing trials on a 
cluster of 13 argon atoms in an attempt to locate the 
"global" minimum energy structure

CRAMBIN Example

Generates a TINKER file from a PDB file, followed by a 
single point energy computation and determination of the 
molecular volume and surface area

CYCLOHEX Example

Locates the transition state between chair and boat 
cyclohexane, with subsequent refinement of the transition 
state and vibrational analysis to show one negative 
frequency

ENKEPHALIN Example

Produces coordinates from the amino acid sequence and 
phi/psi angles, followed by energy minimization and 
determination of the lowest frequency normal mode

FORMAMIDE Example

Converts to a unit cell from fractional coordinates, 
followed by full crystal energy minimization and 
determination of optimal carbonyl oxygen energy parameters 
from a fit to lattice energy and structure

HELIX Example

Performs a rigid-body optimization of the packing of two 
idealized polyalanine helices using only van der Waals 
interactions
 13.    Benchmark Results

     The tables in this section provide CPU benchmarks for 
basic TINKER energy evaluations. All times are in seconds 
and were measured with TINKER 3.7, dimensioned to MAXATM of 
10000 and MAXHESS of 1000000. Each benchmark was run twice 
in rapid succession on a quiet machine. Times reported are 
the fastest results from the second run. Please note that 
many of the machines listed are based on older generation 
CPUs. If you are able to run the benchmarks on additional 
machine types, please send the results for inclusion in a 
future listing.

 14.    Collaborators & Acknowledgments

     The TINKER package has developed over a period of many 
years, very slowly through the mid- to late-1980's, and more 
rapidly since the early 1990's in Jay Ponder's research 
group at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. 
Louis. Many people have played significant roles in the 
development of the package into its current form. The major 
contributors are listed below:


Stew Rubenstein     coordinate interconversions; original 
optimization methods
                    and torsional angle manipulation

Craig Kundrot       molecular surface area & volume and 
their derivatives

Shawn Huston        original AMBER/OPLS implementation; free 
energy
                    calculations; time correlation functions

Mike Dudek          DMA-derived multipole models for 
peptides and proteins

Yong "Mike" Kong    multipole electrostatics; dipole 
polarization; reaction field
                    treatment; TINKER water model

Reece Hart          potential smoothing methodology; 
Scheraga's DEM,
                    Straub's GDA and extensions

Mike Hodsdon        extension of the TINKER distgeom program 
and its
                    application to NMR NOE structure 
determination

Rohit Pappu         potential smoothing methodology and PSS 
algorithms;
                    rigid body optimization

crystal
                    minimization code

Gerald Loeffler     stochastic/Langevin dynamics 
implementation


In addition, we would like to thank Tom Darden for making 
his particle mesh Ewald code generally available to the 
simulation community.

It is critically important that TINKER's distributed force 
field parameter sets exactly reproduce the intent of the 
original force field authors. We would like to thank Julian 
Tirado-Rives (OPLS-AA), Alex MacKerell (CHARMM22), and 
Adrian Roitberg and Carlos Simmerling (AMBER) for their help 
in testing TINKER's results against those given by the 
authentic programs and parameter sets.

Finally, we wish to thank the many users of the TINKER 
package for their suggestions and comments, praise and 
criticism, which have resulted in a variety of improvements.
 15.    References & Suggested Reading

     This section contains a list of the references to 
algorithms and procedures which have been of use during the 
development of TINKER. Methods described in some of the 
references have been implemented in detail within the TINKER 
source code. Other references contain useful background 
information although the algorithms themselves are now 
obsolete. Still other papers contain ideas or extensions 
planned for future inclusion in TINKER. The list is heavily 
skewed toward biomolecules in general and proteins in 
particular. This bias reflects our group's major interests; 
however an attempt has been made to include methods which 
should be generally applicable.
