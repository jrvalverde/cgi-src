<P>
This is a variable metric energy minimization program which 
operates on Cartesian coordinates. The method 
requires computation of energies and gradients as well as 
storage for an estimate of the Hessian matrix. OPTIMIZE will 
typically converge somewhat faster and more completely than 
MINIMIZE. However, the need to store and manipulate a full 
inverse Hessian estimate limits its use to structures 
containing less than a few hundred atoms on workstation 
class machines.</P>

<P>This page will first convert your structure to PDB format
using BABEL, and then process that structure with TINKER, first
converting it to Tinker's XYZ format, then running OPTIMIZE and
finally converting TINKER output back to PDB format.</P>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="lightblue">

<STRONG>Input:</STRONG> You must supply:
<UL>
    <LI>the <STRONG>coordinates</STRONG> of your molecule in 
any of BABEL supported
formats, either as a local file selected from your computer
or pasting the coordinate data in the supplied box.</LI>

    <LI>the input <STRONG>format</STRONG> of your data (make sure it matches
what you have or you may get entirely wrong results)</LI>

    <LI>the <A HREF="params.html"><STRONG>force field</STRONG></A> to use in the minimization procedure</LI>

    <LI>target <STRONG>RMS gradient</STRONG> value at which the minimization 
will terminate (in Kcal/mole/Angstrom)</LI>

    <LI>an <STRONG>e-mail address</STRONG> where the results (see below) will 
be sent</LI>
    
    <LI>an optional <STRONG>urgent-mail address</STRONG> (e.g. a WAP mobile 
phone) where a short notification may be sent (so you may know it's done 
ASAP)</LI>
    
    <LI>a <STRONG>short title</STRONG> to identify your job (this is for your own reference
purposes, so you can identify the results when they are mailed to you)</LI>
</UL></P>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="lightpink">

<P><STRONG>Output</STRONG> will be sent to you by e-mail at the specified address. It
will consist of several files:
<UL>
    <LI>[LOG] the optimization  statistics 
    <LI>[XYZ] the optimized structure in TINKER XYZ format
    <LI>[PDB] the optimized structure in PDB format
    <LI>[SEQ] the sequence corresponding to your structure
</UL></P>
<P>You may also specify an additional e-mail address to receive
a short notification. Typically this would be a mobile phone e-mail
address. This way, if your results are important to you, you will
be notified of program termination as soon as possible.</P>
