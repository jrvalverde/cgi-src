<P>A program to implement Straub's Gaussian Density Annealing 
algorithm over an effective series of analytically smoothed 
potential energy surfaces. This method can be viewed as an 
extended stochastic version of the diffusion equation method 
of Scheraga, et al., and also has many similar features to 
the TINKER Potential Smoothing and Search (PSS) series of 
programs. The current version of GDA is similar to but does 
not exactly reproduce Straub's published method and is 
limited to argon clusters and other simple systems involving 
only van der Waals interactions; further modification and 
development of this code is currently underway in the Ponder 
research group. As with other programs involving potential 
smoothing, GDA currently requires use of the smooth.prm 
force field parameters.</P>

<P>This page will first convert your structure to PDB format
using BABEL, and then process that structure with TINKER, first
converting it to Tinker's XYZ format, then running MINIMIZE and
finally converting TINKER output back to PDB format.</P>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="lightblue">

<STRONG>Input:</STRONG> You must supply:
<UL>
    <LI>the <STRONG>coordinates</STRONG> of your molecule in 
any of BABEL supported
formats, either as a local file selected from your computer
or pasting the coordinate data in the supplied box.</LI>

    <LI>the input <STRONG>format</STRONG> of your data (make sure it matches
what you have or you may get entirely wrong results)</LI>

    <LI>the <A HREF="params.html"><STRONG>force field</STRONG></A> to use in the minimization procedure</LI>

    <LI><STRONG>Number of Annealing trials</STRONG></LI>

    <LI>Whether <STRONG>Random values</STRONG> should be used for the
    initial coordinates</LI>

    <LI><STRONG>Initial and Final Beta values</STRONG></LI>

    <LI>an <STRONG>e-mail address</STRONG> where the results (see below) will 
be sent</LI>
    
    <LI>an optional <STRONG>urgent-mail address</STRONG> (e.g. a WAP mobile 
phone) where a short notification may be sent (so you may know it's done 
ASAP)</LI>
    
    <LI>a <STRONG>short title</STRONG> to identify your job (this is for your own reference
purposes, so you can identify the results when they are mailed to you)</LI>
</UL></P>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="lightpink">

<P><STRONG>Output</STRONG> will be sent to you by e-mail at the specified address. It
will consist of several files:
<UL>
    <LI>[LOG] the simulation  statistics 
    <LI>[XYZ] the final configuration in TINKER XYZ format
    <LI>[PDB] the final configuration in PDB format
</UL></P>
<P>You may also specify an additional e-mail address to receive
a short notification. Typically this would be a mobile phone e-mail
address. This way, if your results are important to you, you will
be notified of program termination as soon as possible.</P>
