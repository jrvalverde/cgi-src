<P>A program that implements the Sniffer global optimization 
algorithm of Butler and Slaminka, a discrete version of 
Griewank's global search trajectory method. The program 
takes an input coordinates file and shakes it 
vigorously via a modified dynamics trajectory before, 
hopefully, settling into a low lying minimum. Some trial and 
error is often required as the current implementation is 
sensitive to various parameters and tolerances that govern 
the computation. At present, these parameters are not user 
accessible, and must be altered in the source code. However, 
this method can do a good job of quickly optimizing 
conformation within a limited range of convergence.</P>

<P>This page will first convert your structure to PDB format
using BABEL, and then process that structure with TINKER, first
converting it to Tinker's XYZ format, then running SNIFFER and
finally converting TINKER output back to PDB format.</P>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="lightblue">

<STRONG>Input:</STRONG> You must supply:
<UL>
    <LI>the <STRONG>coordinates</STRONG> of your molecule in 
any of BABEL supported
formats, either as a local file selected from your computer
or pasting the coordinate data in the supplied box.</LI>

    <LI>the input <STRONG>format</STRONG> of your data (make sure it matches
what you have or you may get entirely wrong results)</LI>

    <LI>the <A HREF="params.html"><STRONG>force field</STRONG></A> to use in the minimization procedure</LI>

    <LI>target <STRONG>RMS gradient</STRONG> value at which the minimization 
will terminate (in Kcal/mole/Angstrom)</LI>

    <!-- removed since any value here generates an infinite loop
    LI>the <STRONG>number of stepst</STRONG>to be taken</LI 
    -->

    <LI>target <STRONG>Energy</STRONG> of the global minimum searched</LI>

    <LI>an <STRONG>e-mail address</STRONG> where the results (see below) will 
be sent</LI>
    
    <LI>an optional <STRONG>urgent-mail address</STRONG> (e.g. a WAP mobile 
phone) where a short notification may be sent (so you may know it's done 
ASAP)</LI>
    
    <LI>a <STRONG>short title</STRONG> to identify your job (this is for your own reference
purposes, so you can identify the results when they are mailed to you)</LI>
</UL></P>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="lightpink">

<P><STRONG>Output</STRONG> will be sent to you by e-mail at the specified address. It
will consist of several files:
<UL>
    <LI>[LOG] the optimization  statistics 
    <LI>[XYZ] the topimized structure in TINKER XYZ format
    <LI>[PDB] the optimized structure in PDB format
    <LI>[SEQ] the sequence corresponding to your structure
</UL></P>
<P>You may also specify an additional e-mail address to receive
a short notification. Typically this would be a mobile phone e-mail
address. This way, if your results are important to you, you will
be notified of program termination as soon as possible.</P>
