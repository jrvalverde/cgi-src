<P>Performs a molecular dynamics simulated annealing 
computation. The program starts from a specified input 
molecular structure. The trajectory is 
updated using either a modified Beeman or a velocity Verlet 
integration method. The annealing protocol is implemented by 
allowing smooth changes between starting and final values of 
the system temperature via the Groningen method of coupling 
to an external bath. The scaling can be linear or sigmoidal 
in nature. In addition, parameters such as cutoff distance 
can be transformed along with the temperature.</P>

<P>A simulated annealing computation consists in simulating the
process of heating a molecule up to a given, possibly denaturing 
temperature and then cooling down to reach again a stable conformation.
The reasoning behind is that a structure might lay in a local
minimum conformation (i.e. a conformation that partially good but not
the optimal one) and by heating we help it exit that configuration and
(possibly) find a new, better, more stable one.</P>

<P>This form will first convert your structure to PDB format
using BABEL, and then process that structure with TINKER, first
converting it to Tinker's XYZ format, then running ANNEAL and
finally converting TINKER output back to PDB format.</P>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="lightblue">

<P>You must supply:
<UL>
    <LI>the <STRONG>coordinates</STRONG> of your molecule in 
any of BABEL supported
formats, either as a local file selected from your computer
or pasting the coordinate data in the supplied box.</LI>

    <LI>the input <STRONG>format</STRONG> of your data (make sure it matches
what you have or you may get entirely wrong results)</LI>

    <LI>the <A HREF="params.html"><STRONG>force field</STRONG></A> to use in the minimization procedure</LI>

    <LI>desired <STRONG>dynamics steps</STRONG> for both, the
equilibration and cooling phases</LI>

    <LI>The type of <STRONG>cooling method</STRONG> you wish to use
    
    <LI>a <STRONG>time interval</STRONG> for the dynamics steps

    <LI>an <STRONG>e-mail address</STRONG> where the results (see below) will 
be sent</LI>
    
    <LI>an optional <STRONG>urgent-mail address</STRONG> (e.g. a WAP mobile 
phone) where a short notification may be sent (so you may know it's done 
ASAP)</LI>
    
    <LI>a <STRONG>short title</STRONG> to identify your job (this is for your own reference
purposes, so you can identify the results when they are mailed to you)</LI>
</UL></P>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="lightpink">

<P>Output will be sent to you by e-mail at the specified address. It
will consist of several files:
<UL>
    <LI>[LOG] the simulated annealing statistics 
    <LI>[XYZ] the annealed structure in TINKER XYZ format
    <LI>[PDB] the annealed structure in PDB format
    <LI>[SEQ] the sequence corresponding to your structure
    <LI>[DYN] a dynamic snapshot including atomic velocities and accelerations
</UL></P>
<P>You may also specify an additional e-mail address to receive
a short notification. Typically this would be a mobile phone e-mail
address. This way, if your results are important to you, you will
be notified of program termination as soon as possible.</P>

<P><STRONG>Please, note that we don't send you the full simulation
snapshots and trajectory, only the latest conformation saved.</STRONG>
Trajectory files easily become <STRONG>HUGE</STRONG> (in the order
of several megabytes) and often give trouble with e-mail. If you want
to analyze trajectory files, please use the command line.</P>
