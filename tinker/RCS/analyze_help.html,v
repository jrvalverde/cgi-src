<P>
Provides information about a specific molecular structure. 
The program will ask for the name of a structure file, and the type of 
analysis desired. Options allow output of:  (1) total 
potential energy of the system, (2) breakdown of the energy 
by potential function type or over individual atoms, (3) 
computation of the total dipole moment and its components, 
moments of inertia and radius of gyration, (4) listing of 
the parameters used to compute selected interaction 
energies, (5) energies associated with specified individual 
interactions.</P>

<P>The command line program allows you to specify which details
to include (i.e. specific atoms or atom interactions), however,
this form will <EM>always</EM> produce a full listing of <EM>ALL</EM>
details and hence potentially very long output.</P>

<P>This page will first convert your structure to PDB format
using BABEL, and then process that structure with TINKER, first
converting it to Tinker's XYZ format and finally running ANALYZE.</P>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="lightblue">

<STRONG>Input:</STRONG> You must supply:
<UL>
    <LI>the <STRONG>coordinates</STRONG> of your molecule in 
any of BABEL supported
formats, either as a local file selected from your computer
or pasting the coordinate data in the supplied box.</LI>

    <LI>the input <STRONG>format</STRONG> of your data (make sure it matches
what you have or you may get entirely wrong results)</LI>

    <LI>the <A HREF="params.html"><STRONG>force field</STRONG></A> to use in the minimization procedure</LI>

    <LI>desired <STRONG>Analysis types</STRONG>: you may select any of a choice
    of analysis, from a single one to any combination or all of them:
    <UL>
    	<LI>Total Potential Energy and its Components<LI>
    	<LI>Energy Breakdown over each of the Atoms 
	    <STRONG>CAUTION: generates LONG output</STRONG></LI>
    	<LI>List of the Large Individual Interactions</LI>
    	<LI>Details for All Individual Interactions</LI>
    	<LI>Radius of Gyration and Moments of Inertia</LI>
    	<LI>Total Electrical Charge and Dipole Moment</LI>
    	<LI>Force Field Parameters for Interactions
	    <STRONG>CAUTION: generates VERY LONG output</STRONG></LI>

    </UL></LI>

    <LI>an <STRONG>e-mail address</STRONG> where the results (see below) will 
be sent</LI>
    
    <LI>an optional <STRONG>urgent-mail address</STRONG> (e.g. a WAP mobile 
phone) where a short notification may be sent (so you may know it's done 
ASAP)</LI>
    
    <LI>a <STRONG>short title</STRONG> to identify your job (this is for your own reference
purposes, so you can identify the results when they are mailed to you)</LI>
</UL></P>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="lightpink">

<P><STRONG>Output</STRONG> will be sent to you by e-mail at the specified address. It
will consist of several files:
<UL>
    <LI>[LOG] the analysis results 
</UL></P>
<P>You may also specify an additional e-mail address to receive
a short notification. Typically this would be a mobile phone e-mail
address. This way, if your results are important to you, you will
be notified of program termination as soon as possible.</P>
