<P>Performs a molecular dynamics (MD) or stochastic dynamics 
(SD) computation. Starts either from a specified input 
molecular structure or from a structure-
velocity-acceleration set saved from a previous dynamics 
trajectory (a restart from a .dyn file). MD trajectories are 
propagated using either a modified Beeman or a velocity 
Verlet integration method. SD is implemented via our own 
derivation of a velocity Verlet-based algorithm. In addition 
the program can perform full crystal calculations, and can 
operate in constant energy mode or with maintenance of a 
desired temperature and/or pressure using the Groningen 
method of coupling to external baths.
</P>

<P>The simulation may be pictured as taking your molecule and
putting it in a bath at the desired temperature for a period
of time. This kind of simulations may help you picture the dynamic
behaviour of your molecule at a given temperature.</P>

<P>This page will first convert your structure to PDB format
using BABEL, and then process that structure with TINKER, first
converting it to Tinker's XYZ format, then running DYNAMIC and
finally converting TINKER output back to PDB format.</P>

</TD></TR>

<STRONG>Input:</STRONG> You must supply:
<UL>
    <LI>the <STRONG>coordinates</STRONG> of your molecule in 
any of BABEL supported
formats, either as a local file selected from your computer
or pasting the coordinate data in the supplied box.</LI>

    <LI>the input <STRONG>format</STRONG> of your data (make sure it matches
what you have or you may get entirely wrong results)</LI>

    <LI>the <A HREF="params.html"><STRONG>force field</STRONG></A> to use in the minimization procedure</LI>

    <LI>desired <STRONG>number of steps</STRONG> that the symulation is going
    to last</LI>

    <LI><STRONG>time length</STRONG> of each simulation step</LI>

    <LI>target <STRONG>temperature</STRONG> (in degrees Kelvin) to use</LI>

    <LI>an <STRONG>e-mail address</STRONG> where the results (see below) will 
be sent</LI>
    
    <LI>an optional <STRONG>urgent-mail address</STRONG> (e.g. a WAP mobile 
phone) where a short notification may be sent (so you may know it's done 
ASAP)</LI>
    
    <LI>a <STRONG>short title</STRONG> to identify your job (this is for your own reference
purposes, so you can identify the results when they are mailed to you)</LI>
</UL></P>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="lightpink">

<P><STRONG>Output</STRONG> will be sent to you by e-mail at the specified address. It
will consist of several files:
<UL>
    <LI>[LOG] the simulation  statistics 
    <LI>[XYZ] the modelled structure in TINKER XYZ format
    <LI>[PDB] the modelled structure in PDB format
    <LI>[SEQ] the sequence corresponding to your structure
    <LI>[DYN] a dynamic snapshot including atomic velocities and accelerations
</UL></P>
<P>You may also specify an additional e-mail address to receive
a short notification. Typically this would be a mobile phone e-mail
address. This way, if your results are important to you, you will
be notified of program termination as soon as possible.</P>

<P><STRONG>Please, note that we don't send you the full simulation
snapshots and trajectory, only the latest conformation saved.</STRONG>
Trajectory files easily become <STRONG>HUGE</STRONG> (in the order
of several megabytes) and often give trouble with e-mail. If you want
to analyze trajectory files, please use the command line.</P>
