<P>Performs a nonlinear conjugate gradient minimization of an 
input structure over Cartesian coordinates. The method 
requires only the potential energy and gradient at each step 
along the minimization pathway. It requires storage space 
proportional to the number of atoms in the structure. The 
MINIMIZE procedure is recommended for preliminary 
minimization of trial structures to an RMS gradient of 1.0 
to 0.1 kcal/mole/Ang. It has a relatively fast cycle time 
and is tolerant of poor initial structures, but converges 
very slowly (linearly) once near the minimum.</P>

<P>This page will first convert your structure to PDB format
using BABEL, and then process that structure with TINKER, first
converting it to Tinker's XYZ format, then running MINIMIZE and
finally converting TINKER output back to PDB format.</P>

<STRONG>Input:</STRONG> You must supply:
<UL>
    <LI>the <STRONG>coordinates</STRONG> of your molecule in 
any of BABEL supported
formats, either as a local file selected from your computer
or pasting the coordinate data in the supplied box.</LI>

    <LI>the input <STRONG>format</STRONG> of your data (make sure it matches
what you have or you may get entirely wrong results)</LI>

    <LI>the <A HREF="params.html"><STRONG>force field</STRONG></A> to use in the minimization procedure</LI>

    <LI>target <STRONG>RMS gradient</STRONG> value at which the minimization 
will terminate (in Kcal/mole/Angstrom)</LI>

    <LI>an <STRONG>e-mail address</STRONG> where the results (see below) will 
be sent</LI>
    
    <LI>an optional <STRONG>urgent-mail address</STRONG> (e.g. a WAP mobile 
phone) where a short notification may be sent (so you may know it's done 
ASAP)</LI>
    
    <LI>a <STRONG>short title</STRONG> to identify your job (this is for your own reference
purposes, so you can identify the results when they are mailed to you)</LI>
</UL></P>

<P><STRONG>Output</STRONG> will be sent to you by e-mail at the specified address. It
will consist of several files:
<UL>
    <LI>[LOG] the minimization  statistics 
    <LI>[XYZ] the minimized structure in TINKER XYZ format
    <LI>[PDB] the minimized structure in PDB format
    <LI>[SEQ] the sequence corresponding to your structure
</UL></P>
<P>You may also specify an additional e-mail address to receive
a short notification. Typically this would be a mobile phone e-mail
address. This way, if your results are important to you, you will
be notified of program termination as soon as possible.</P>
