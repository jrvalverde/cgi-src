Various CGIs we have written along the years (for Molecular Biology mainly, but not only)
in the Scientific Computing Service of CNB/CSIC

You will also find here some servlets to manipulate Computational Biology data using web
services.

I will add a more detailed listing later on.

All of these formed part of the once mytical EMBnet/CNB web site, a place where you could 
do practically anything imaginable in Molecular Biology or Computational Biology (before
funding cuts forced its shutdown).
