<H1>Refining your model</H1>

<HR>

<P>We can try to improve our model's quality using a variety of
techniques. The most commonly used of these are <STRONG>simulated
annealing</STRONG> and <STRONG>molecular dynamics</STRONG>.</P>

<P>Strictly speaking all of these techniques are based on a discipline
called <STRONG>Molecular Dynamics</STRONG>, however, common jargon uses
the same term for a special type of modellization technique too.</P>

<H2>Simulated annealing</H2>

<P>A simulated annealing computation consists in simulating the process 
of heating a molecule up to a given, possibly denaturing temperature and 
then cooling down to reach again a stable conformation. The reasoning 
behind is that a structure might lay in a local minimum conformation 
(i.e. a conformation that partially good but not the optimal one) and 
by heating we help it exit that configuration and (possibly) find a 
new, better, more stable one.</P>

<P>This <EM>in silico</EM> experiment is carried on using Molecular Dynamics
techniques, which relie on a <EM>force field</EM> description of the
interactions occurring between molecular components to calculate the
energies and dynamic trajectories of the simulation.
As such, it requires that you specify a force field to define
the parameters of the computation.</P>

<H2>Molecular Dynamics</H2>

<P>This simulation may be pictured as taking your molecule and putting 
it in a bath at the desired temperature for a period of time. This kind
of simulations may help you picture the dynamic behaviour of your 
molecule at a given temperature. It will also allow your molecule
some freedom to explore the conformation space at the desired temperature.
Selecting a model temperature of 300K (approximately room temperature),
will hopefully allow us to explore the possible conformation of our
molecule in its native state.</P>

<P>Like with simulated annealing, we will be using Molecular Dynamics
methods to run the simulation and we will need to select the parameters
we use for each interaction modelled, i.e. the <EM>force field</EM> to
apply.</P>


<H2>The force field</H2>

<P>A force field is just a theoretical description of the interactions
that take place in a molecular environment. It usually assumes the
form:</P>
<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="80%" BORDER="2">
<TR><TD><CENTER>E<SUB>tot</SUB> = E<SUB>bond</SUB> + E<SUB>angle</SUB> 
+ E<SUB>dihedral</SUB> + E<SUB>non-bond</SUB></TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<P>The total energy of the system is described as the sum of various
different kinds of interaction energies (bonds, angles, dihedrals and
non-bonded interactions). Of these, the latter are the most computation
intensive involving a sum over all atoms of Van der Waals and electrostatic
interactions.</P>

<P>A number of force fields have been proposed, each differing in the
values assigned to different parameters and the complexity of the
interactions computed. These differences are most often oriented to 
optimize computation for specific kinds of molecules. The force
fields most commonly used in protein modelling are <STRONG>AMBER</STRONG>
and <STRONG>CHARMM</STRONG>.</P>


<H2>Selecting simulation lengths</H2>

<IMG SRC="images/dragon_fly.gif" ALT="Dragon" WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="75" ALIGN="RIGHT">

<P>Real world processes happen at great speed, normally taking a very
short time to fold a protein into its native state. However, although
these times may seem short for us (in the range of microseconds), they 
are still too long to be simulated in a computer.</P>

<P>A computer simulation will take place in many small steps, usually 
modelling the molecular behaviour after each <EM>femtosecond</EM>, and
at a considerable cost in computation time. As a consequence, we can
usually run the simulation for only a few <EM>picoseconds</EM>, a time 
that is too short by molecular standards. Attempting to run the
simulation for longer periods may result in years of computation time.
<STRONG>Simulated times are too short because they take too long.</STRONG></P>

<TABLE BORDER="0" ALIGN="CENTER">
<TR><TD>1 second</TD><TD>1000 milliseconds</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>1 millisecond</TD><TD>1000 microseconds</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>1 microsecond</TD><TD>1000 nanoseconds</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>1 nanosecond</TD><TD>1000 picoseconds</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>1 picosecond</TD><TD>1000 femtoseconds</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>We <STRONG>must</STRONG> neccessarily use short simulation periods
(picoseconds), and therefore, we should always bear in mind that these
are too short for a realistic simulation to take place. However, with a
bit of luck we will <EM>hopefully</EM> find a structure that is  
optimal or very close to the real one. But, <STRONG>beware</STRONG>! It may also happen 
that these cycles take us farther away from the optimal structure we are 
looking for!</P>

<P><STRONG>That is why we need to iterate the refinement process several 
times and validate the model after each one</STRONG>: we want to 
continue improving our model until we feel we are reasonably close enough 
to the real one. If we instead see that we are getting away (because the
model quality deteriorates), we should go back to the latest refined
model and start again (unless every new try deteriorates the model and we
give up).</P>
