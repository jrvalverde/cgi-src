<H1>Validating your model</H1>

<HR>

<P>After each refinement step, it is convenient to validate the
quality of our model. This <STRONG>cannot faithfully be done</STRONG>!.</P>

<P>What we mean by the above statement is that the only faithful
validation test is a comparison of our model to the reality, and
since we don't know the real one, we can hardly do that.</P>

<P>However, we <STRONG>can</STRONG> compare our model against a set
of rules that are usually followed by most proteins. Experience does
tell us that <EM>in general</EM> proteins tend to follow a series
of rules when folding. It is these rules that we can check.</P>

<P>Note that we will compare our model against <EM>rules</EM>. As
the saying goes, <EM>rules are meant to be broken</EM>! This is to
say, while most proteins will follow the rules in most instances,
there are occasions when some may not. After all, these rules are
derived by finding the "mean" behaviour of residues, bonds and atoms
in proteins, and they are only "average standards", not stone-clad
laws.</P>

<P>So, what can we do with this? Well, first, run the validation
tests and see what comes out. This will tell you how your model
complies with "standard average" behaviour.</P>

<P>If there are gross deviations from standard behaviour, it most
probably means that your model needs further refinement. Otherwise,
you need to look at them closely to see if these deviations do
actually make sense in the context of your protein.</P>

<P>Easy, isn't it? It all reduces to running the checks and deciding 
if each deviation seen can be explained by the special properties of
our protein. But, what are these special properties? And, foremost,
how do they reflect in the structure?</P>

<P>If you are an expert, it should be obvious, but if you aren't, 
there's a simple trick that will tell you fast and easy which deviations
may be "normal" or accpetable for your protein: all that is required is
that you run the same validation suite against one or more proteins of
the same family as yours taken from PDB. Since these proteins are
actual, real-world, wild-type native proteins, any deviations from the
standard behaviour they display must be "normal" for the family, and
if they appear in your model too, they may be considered as "normal"
as well and you may discard them safely.</P>

<P>Beware: it <EM>might be</EM> that your protein is the exception to the
rules of the family, and some caution must be exercised when considering
the relevance of deviations. Moreover, your protein <EM>might have</EM>
special characteristics that substantially make it differ from the
family standards. Here it is where the knowledge you gained by reviewing
the literature and experimental data will be most useful for you as a
help in decision making.</P>

<P>If you didn't review the literature, please, do so now to ensure you are
correctly validating your protein.</P>
