<H1>Studying the protein</H1>

<HR>

<P>The success of our analysis will depend on our interpretation of
its results. The computer will apply a theoretical model to the data
we feed it, and will provide us in return with a theoretical
solution.</P>

<P>Since the theoretical approaches used are only approximations and
make a number of shortcuts, so the results we get will come out as mere
approximations and we must exercise care in accepting or rejecting them.
The only way to be critic about the computer results is to know in
advance as much about the protein we want to model as possible.</P>

<P>Finding out details about a protein relies mainly on experimental
data, either found by ourselves or discovered by our fellow scientists.
Most of this data will probably have been published in the Scientific
Literature, and that's the first place to look for it. We can't possibly
list all entry points to the scientific literature, mainly because most
of it is not accessible on the WWW, but we do have some recommendations
that we think make for good starting points:</P>

<UL>
    <LI><STRONG>Medline</STRONG> is the most popular database in Life
    Sciences. It started as an expanded electronic version of <EM>Index
    Medicus</EM> and covers most of the literature related (even
    remotely) to Life Sciences, together with abstracts and links to
    other sources of information.</LI>
    
    <LI><STRONG>PubMed Central</STRONG> is a digital archive of life sciences 
    journal literature including <EM>full article contents</EM></LI>
    
    <LI><STRONG>The Public Library of Science</STRONG> is a non-profit 
    organization of scientists committed to making the world's scientific 
    and medical literature freely accessible to scientists and to the 
    public</LI>
    
    <LI><STRONG>PNAS</STRONG> has been one of the first Journals to
    make its contents freely available on the WWW shortly after publication.</LI>
    
    <LI><STRONG>The WWW Virtual Library</STRONG> is a broad resource of
    reference material on a wide number of scientific disciplines.</LI>

<P>These were just a few starting points, there are much more, and you will
surely know the most relevant ones in your field. Please note that these
databases do not cover exhaustively all scientific knowledge, and may be
sometimes outdated or contain errors. You are well advised to check out
the results, contrast them with printed material and common wisdom and
exercise rational criticism on anything reported in the literature. Blind
gullibility is never good.</P>

<P>There is some data which is not vailable in the literature, or for which 
literary references are not available, too new, too old or no longer accessible. 
A lot of this data is available from other databases, oriented to specific
experimental data. It is a good idea to look up these databases too, both
generic and specialized databases on experimental scientific knowledge.</P>

<P>The wealth of experimental knowledge databases is so huge that we can't
aspire to list it all here. Even if we could, there are new databases popping
up all around every so often, and you are better qualified to know
about them than we are. Some starting points that we know to be good and
popular are:</P>
