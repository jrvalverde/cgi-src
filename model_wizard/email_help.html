<H1>Using e-mail models</H1>

<HR>

<P>Many servers will happily take your molecular structural data
and apply some process to it. Modelling tasks often take long
times to complete, and it doesn't make any sense to have you tied
to the computer waiting for a potentially long period to get your
results. Instead, the server asks you for an e-mail address and
sends the results to it when finished.</P>

<P>Whenever you get your results by e-mail, you will receive one
or more messages with the detailed output, among them, at least
one will contain the final 3-D coordinates of the protein. Since
looking at boring 3-D coordinates is not one of the most exciting
tasks to do on a Friday afternoon, most times you will want to
pass on these coordinates to other programs.</P>

<P>There are two ways in which you can further use the coordinates
you received by e-mail:</P>

<OL>
    <LI>Using "copy-and-paste" techniques: just go to the start
    of the structural data, copy from it to the bottom of the
    section and then paste the data on another program (a text
    editor, a WWW form, etc.).</LI>
    
    <LI>Saving the coordinates to a local file and using it. This
    is the most useful way, for it works both with local programs
    (which usually only accept files as input) and most remoteS
    servers (which usually accpet file uploading).</LI>
</OL>

<STRONG>Caution</STRONG> must be exercised however when saving an e-mail
with 3-D coordinates data. If you save the full E-mail as such, then 
additional bits of information (like e-mail headers) will be saved as
well. These do not form part of the coordinates data and may fool many
programs into giving wrong results or not working at all.</P>

<P>To make sure, inspect the message, see if it contains any free text
before or after the coordinate data, and if there is none, save
<STRONG>the message contents</STRONG> but <STRONG>not</STRONG> the
message headers.</P>

<P>If the message contains any additional information, you will need
to save the message to a file and manually remove it using a <em>text
editor</em> or <em>word processor</em> and making sure you save the
modified file as <STRONG>text only</STRONG> or <STRONG>ASCII</STRONG>
format.</P>
