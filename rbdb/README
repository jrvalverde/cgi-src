INSTALLATION
============

    QUICK & DIRTY
    -------------

To install, simply uncompress and extract the distributed sources on any
directory within your web server document area.

First you need to create the database on MySQL. In order to do this,
you may use the script provided under data/RB.tab.mysql : first you
should edit this file and set an appropriate password for the database
user, then source it from mysql.

Secondly you must edit config.inc to set the password for the database
user to the same you used in the RB.tab.mysql when creating the mysql
database user.

You need to initially populate the database with seed data. This may be
obtained from the main web site:

	http://www.es.embnet.org/Services/MolBio/rbdb/.

Simply make an empty query and save the results as TAB-delimited format.
Then you may import the data on your local mySQL server using the provided
forms and scripts.

If you have any doubts, problems, etc.. please contact the author of the
web interface:

	jr@acm.org


    DETAILS
    -------
    
    1. Creating the database
    
The database is managed through MySQL. In future versions we may consider
using ADODB so it becomes independent of the underlying engine, but for
now you are stuck with using MySQL. It is free, it is GNU, it is terribly
good... not that bad.

First you must create the database, and associated table. Right now this is
a very simple database: it only contains one table!

The script ./data/RB.tab.mysql may help you get started creating the database,
its table and loading an initial dataset in Tab-delimited format.

This script will create a database called "rbdb". If you want to use another
name, edit the script appropriately and note down the new name for later.

Then, it will add a new user with privileges to maintain and query the
database. This user is also called "rbdb". Again if you would rather have
it called otherwise, just edit the script and note down the new name. Note
that you MUST also change the name of the computers from which this user
is going to access the database (i.e. the web server(s) that will be
running these scripts).

Finally, a password must be set for this user. YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY EDIT
the script and use a good password for this user. If nothing else, this
must absolutely be done: you may use the default database and user name
but must change the password to something SAFE. Note it down as well.

If you run the script from mysql, you will get a new user and database
added, the later populated with the seed data you selected. Now you can
move to the next step.

    2. Configuring the user interface
    
Not much to be done here: simply edit the file config.inc and state on
it the host where mysql is running, the name of the database, the user
name to manage and access the database and the password for this user
name.

This file is protected by using a .htaccess file that has been crafted
for Apache. YMMV and if you use a different Web server you will need to
protect if from peeping eyes to avoid publishing your mysql user/password.

    3. You are done
