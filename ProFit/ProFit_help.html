<P><STRONG>ProFit</STRONG> [1] (pronounced Pro-Fit, not profit!) uses 
McLachlan fitting algorithm,
essentially a steepest descents minimisation as described in McLachlan, A.D.
(1982) <I>Rapid comparison of Protein Structures</I>, <B>Acta Cryst. A38</B>,
871-873. ProFit is designed to be the ultimate program for performins least 
squares fits of two protein structures. <STRONG>The following paragraphs
address the functionality of ProFit that is available from THIS 
service.</STRONG></P>

<P>ProFit requires as input two structures: the <EM>reference</EM> structure
that remains static in space and the <EM>mobile</EM> structure which is
fitted onto it.</P>

<P>ProFit addresses the question of sorting out equivalent atoms by doing
a sequence alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. It then performs
a least squares fitting of the equivalent residues in the two structures
using N, C-alpha, C and O atoms, and produces the following reports:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>A summary of the run describing what has been done and including
    <UL>
    	<LI>The Needleman-Wunsch alignment used to guide the fit</LI>
	<LI>The summary of RMS deviation between both structures</LI>
	<LI>The Centers of Gravity of the structures</LI>
	<LI>The space transformations used for the fit</LI>
    </UL></LI>
    <LI>A detailed RMS calculation describing the by residue RMS deviation</LI>
    <LI>The fitted <EM>mobile</EM> structure in PDB format</LI>
    <LI>A PostScript representation of the fitted molecule</LI>
    <LI>A VRML 2 model of the fitted molecule.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Please note that the program is called <STRONG>ProFit</STRONG> --- not PROFIT, Profit or
profit; this attempts to avoid confusion with the threading program
known as PROFIT. <STRONG>ProFit</STRONG> was written first and released to the public
around the same time.</P>

<P>ProFit is able to perform more powerful and detailed analysis. To access
its full functionality you should use it with the command line interface</P>

[1]  Please reference usage of this program as follows:<BR>
  Fitting was performed using the McLachlan algorithm (MnLachlan, A. D.,
  1982 "Rapid Comparison of Protein Structures", Acta Cryst A38, 871-873)
  as implemented in the program ProFit (Martin, A.C.R., 
  <A HREF="http://www.bioinf.org.uk/software/">http://www.bioinf.org.uk/software/</A>).
